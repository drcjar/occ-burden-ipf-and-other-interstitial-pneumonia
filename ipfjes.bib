  Abstract                 = {This review assesses the contribution of occupational asbestos exposure to the occurrence of mesothelioma and lung cancer in Europe. Available information on national asbestos consumption, proportions of the population exposed, and exposure levels is summarized. Population-based studies from various European regions on occupational asbestos exposure, mesothelioma, and lung cancer are reviewed. Asbestos consumption in 1994 ranged, per capita, between 0. 004 kg in northern Europe and 2.4 kg in the former Soviet Union. Population surveys from northern Europe indicate that 15 to 30\% of the male (and a few percent of the female) population has ever had occupational exposure to asbestos, mainly in construction (75\% in Finland) or in shipyards. Studies on mesothelioma combining occupational history with biologic exposure indices indicate occupational asbestos exposure in 62 to 85\% of the cases. Population attributable risks for lung cancer among males range between 2 and 50\% for definite asbestos exposure. After exclusion of the most extreme values because of methodologic aspects, most of the remaining estimates are within the range of 10 to 20\%. Estimates of women are lower. Extrapolation of the results to national figures would decrease the estimates. Norwegian estimates indicate that one-third of expected asbestos-related lung cancers might be avoided if former asbestos workers quit smoking. The combination of a current high asbestos consumption per capita, high exposure levels, and high underlying lung cancer rates in Central Europe and the former Soviet Union suggests that the lung cancers will arise from the smoking-asbestos interaction should be a major concern.},

  Abstract                 = {The present article reports on two conceptual and methodological issues concerning interstitial lung disease (ILD) about which there is a lot of misunderstanding and contradiction: the investigation of epidemics and clusters and the classification and epidemiology of ILD. In general, an epidemic is the occurrence of cases of an illness in excess of normal expectancy. The investigation of an epidemic often demands a number of sequential studies: first descriptive, then aetiological. Clusters consist of an increase in incidence of much smaller magnitude, perhaps excluding the possibility that this is merely a result of chance. In recent years, more valid statistical methods for the assessment of clusters have developed. For interstitial lung disease in particular, different classifications exist that are sometimes inconsistent and may change with time. All diseases require a process of ascertainment, whereby they are identified, classified and perhaps registered. The two most employed epidemiological techniques for testing aetiological hypotheses are the cohort and case-referent approaches.},

  Abstract                 = {Increased prevalence of chronic interstitial pneumonia (CIP) is reported in dust-exposed subjects. We investigated the prevalence of CIP in silicosis and mixed-dust pneumoconiosis and sought morphologic differences of CIP between the pneumoconiosis and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).We reviewed CT scans of 243 silicosis and mixed-dust pneumoconiosis patients to identify any cases of parenchymal lung lesions showing a CIP pattern, and compared the CT findings with those of 62 patients with IPF. Two observers independently scored CT images and classified the CT pattern as typical or not typical for IPF. Differences were sought between the groups using a nonparametric test, Fisher exact test, and a logistic regression analysis. A radiopathologic correlation was performed in 11 pneumoconiosis patients.Twenty-eight patients (11.5\%) showed CIP on CT. Seven patients (25\%) showed a pattern not typical of IPF, while the remaining patients showed a pattern typical of IPF, 11 of which were confirmed pathologically. The extent of fibrosis did not differ between the groups; however, patients with pneumoconiosis showed less traction bronchiectasis (odds ratio [OR], 0.19; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.08 to 0.48; p < 0.001), more subpleural homogeneous attenuation (OR, 2.56; 95\% CI, 1.55 to 4.23; p < 0.001), and fibrosis was more randomly distributed (OR, 315.38; 95\% CI, 4.68 to 21244.63; p = 0.007). Pathologically, subpleural homogeneous attenuation corresponded to dense fibrosis often with abundant silicotic nodules.Prevalence of CIP in pneumoconiosis was approximately 12\% on CT. One fourth of patients showed an atypical IPF pattern, and the others showed a typical IPF pattern.},

  Abstract                 = {Random error (misclassification) in exposure measurements usually biases a relative risk, regression coefficient, or other effect measure towards the null value (no association). The most important exception is Berkson type error, which causes little or no bias. Berkson type error arises, in particular, due to use of group average exposure in place of individual values. Random error in exposure measurements, Berkson or otherwise, reduces the power of a study, making it more likely that real associations are not detected. Random error in confounding variables compromises the control of their effect, leaving residual confounding. Random error in a variable that modifies the effect of exposure on health--for example, an indicator of susceptibility--tends to diminish the observed modification of effect, but error in the exposure can create a supurious appearance of modification. Methods are available to correct for bias (but not generally power loss) due to measurement error, if information on the magnitude and type of error is available. These methods can be complicated to use, however, and should be used cautiously as "correction" can magnify confounding if it is present.},

  Abstract                 = {Thirty-five necropsied cases of diffuse malignant mesothelioma of pleura and six cases of mesothelioma of peritoneum are reported. Occupational histories from 40 cases showed that 32 cases (80\%) were definitely exposed to asbestos; six cases (15\%) were probably exposed and two (5\%) had no known exposure. The mean latent interval was 34 years. Occupational histories of 56 control patients matched in pairs for age and sex with 28 of the mesothelioma cases revealed definite exposure to asbestos in 12 controls (21\%), probable exposure in 11 (20\%), and no evidence of exposure in 33 (59\%). The difference in incidence of exposure between mesotheliomas and controls is statistically highly significant. Six-micron histological sections of lung, available in 39 mesothelioma cases, contained coated asbestos fibres in 36 cases (92\%). Sixteen cases of mesothelioma showing fibres were free of asbestosis; asbestosis was slight in 14 cases, moderately severe in five cases, and severe in one case. The incidence of asbestos bodies in sections from mesothelioma cases was significantly higher than in a previously reported series of routine necropsies examined by lung smear. Counts of coated and uncoated asbestos fibres were performed on samples of lung tissue from 33 mesothelioma cases. No fibres were identified in one case and only occasional coated fibres in a second case. The remainder gave counts ranging from 154 thousand to 684 million fibres per gram dry weight. Uncoated fibres were invariably present and usually comprised 50 to 80\% of the count. No relationship was found between total fibre count and the latent period of the mesothelioma. Fibre counts were also performed on lung samples from 18 smear-positive and 30 smear-negative routine necropsies. Cases with numerous coated fibres in the smear gave total fibre counts similar to those of mesothelioma cases without asbestosis. Routine cases with only one fibre in the smear usually yielded only occasional fibres on analysis. Coated and uncoated fibres were found in 13 out of 30 smear-negative cases, indicating a true incidence of 56\% of exposure to asbestos in the whole necropsy series. When compared with the mesothelioma series the difference in incidence of fibres remains statistically significant. The data suggest that, on Tyneside, exposure to asbestos sufficient to cause an appreciable risk of developing mesothelioma has usually occurred through occupational exposure rather than by general environmental pollution by asbestos.},

  Abstract                 = {Despite the advances in medical therapy and technology, the prognosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) remains poor and the need for disease prevention based on identifying the risk factors becomes mandatory. Occupational and environmental exposures were studied in several countries and found to play important role in the disease development. However, in Egypt, a little attention has been paid to study the effect of these factors in the disease development.To identify the occupational and environmental risk factors associated with the development of IPF in Egypt.A multicenter hospital-based case-control study was carried out in chest hospitals affiliated to three Egyptian cities-Cairo, Tanta and Mansoura. Subjects were 201 patients with confirmed IPF (cases) and 205 age-, sex- and residence-matched controls. Data on occupational and environmental factors were obtained from a questionnaire. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to determine the independent risk factors of IPF in both sexes for single factors with adjustment for age, residence and smoking status.Compared with the controls, the risk of IPF in male workers was observed to increase significantly in chemical and petrochemical industries and carpentry and wood working (OR = 2.56, 95\% CI: 1.02-7.01), and with occupational exposures to wood dust and wood preservatives. Among female workers, a significant increase was observed in farming (OR = 3.34, 95\% CI: 1.17-10.12), raising birds and occupational exposures to animal feeds, products and dusts and pesticides. Risk of IPF decreased significantly in male workers and insignificantly among female workers in sales and clerical related activities. The environmental exposures to birds and cats were significantly associated with elevated risk of IPF development in both sexes.In Egypt, farming, raising birds and wood working are important risk factors for the development of IPF.},

The questionnaire asked for information on smoking habits, occupational airborne exposure and respiratory disorders.A random sample of 4992 subjects from the general population aged 15-70 years of Hordaland County, Norway.The overall response rate was 90\%, with a 63\% response to the initial letter. The response rates to the first and second reminder letters were 56\% and 36\% respectively. In 20\% of the non-respondents an uncompleted questionnaire was returned with cause for non-response; in two thirds of these the cause for non-response was that the subject was not resident at the mailing address. A home visit to a random sample of 50 urban non-respondents provided further information on 29 subjects. A wrong address at the Central Population Registry and the subject's feeling of lack of personal benefit from a postal survey were the major reasons for non-response. Smokers were late respondents and subjects with respiratory disorders tended to be early respondents.The main reasons for non-response were a wrong mailing address and a feeling of lack of personal benefit from responding. Using only the initial letter would have changed the estimated prevalence of smokers from 39\% to 35\%. Otherwise, the estimated prevalence of the exposure and disease variables as well as the associations between them were only slightly changed after including the respondents to the first and second reminder letters.},

Results are based on 248 cases, aged 20-75 years, diagnosed at 16 referral centers between January 1989 and July 1993. There were 491 controls ascertained by random digit dialing and matched to cases on sex, age, and geographic region. Data were collected using a standard telephone questionnaire. Occupational factors were based on a detailed history of jobs lasting 6 months or more and job activity, hobby, and specific substance checklists. Several occupational factors, adjusted for age and smoking in conditional multivariate logistic regression analyses, were significantly associated with IPF: farming (odds ratio (OR) = 1.6, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.0, 2.5); livestock (OR = 2.7, 95\% CI: 1.3, 5.5); hairdressing (OR = 4.4, 95\% CI: 1.2, 16.3); metal dust (OR = 2.0, 95\% CI: 1.0, 4.0); raising birds (OR = 4.7, 95\% CI: 1.6, 14.1); stone cutting/polishing (OR = 3.9, 95\% CI: 1.2, 12.7); and vegetable dust/animal dust (OR = 4.7, 95\% CI: 2.1, 10.4). Interaction was detected between smoking and exposure to livestock (p = 0.06) and farming (p = 0.08). Results confirm previous studies showing increased risk associated with dusty environments.},

The study included 248 cases, and 491 control subjects identified through random-digit dialing, matched to cases in sex, age, and geographic region. Telephone interviews were conducted with both cases and controls to collect information on potential risk factors for IPF, including smoking and household, occupational, and environmental exposures. Pulmonary function tests, X-rays, computed tomographic (CT) scans of the chest, and lung biopsy reports were submitted by referring centers to support the diagnoses. An a priori hypothesis that smoking is associated with IPF was examined with conditional logistic regression analyses. More cases (72\%) than control subjects (63\%) had a history of ever smoking. The odds ratio (OR) for ever smoking was 1.6 (95\% CI: 1.1 to 2.4). Risk was significantly elevated for former smokers (OR = 1.9; 95\% CI: 1.3 to 2.9) and for smokers with 21 to 40 pack-yr (OR = 2.3; 95\% CI: 1.3 to 3.8). A history of smoking is associated with an increased risk for the development of IPF. Although there was no clear exposure-response pattern with cumulative consumption of cigarettes, there was a trend for time since cessation of smoking, with the highest risk for those who had most recently quit.},

  Abstract                 = {idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a generally fatal disorder with a reported median survival of 3 to 6 yr. This has been based on relatively few studies with diagnoses inconsistently confirmed by ade- quate lung biopsy. Retrospective analysis of 104 patients with IPF who had open lung biopsy (OLB) at Mayo Medical Center from 1976 to 1985 was performed to establish the overall survival rate, the spectrum of histopathological subgroups and their associated prognostic significance. The study group consisted of 54 men and 50 women with a median age of 63 yr. Median survival was 3.8 yr af- ter diagnosis by OLB with an estimated 10 yr survival of 27%. Current histopathologic review showed a heterogeneous group including usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), desquamative interstitial pneu- monia (DIP), nonspecific interstitial pneumonia/fibrosis (NSIP), acute interstitial pneumonia (AIP), bronchiolitis, bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), and others. Median survival of the UIP group was 2.8 yr which is significantly worse (p ? 0.001) than for other subgroups of chronic interstitial pneumonias. IPF includes several histopathologic subgroups with significantly different survival rates. Patients with UIP have worse survival than patients with other types of idiopathic chronic interstitial pneumonias including NSIP. Accurate histopathologic classification is essential for prognostication in patients with IPF. Bjoraker JA, Ryu JH, Edwin MK, Myers JL, Tazelaar HD, Schroeder DR, Offord KP.

IPF/UIP and NSIP closely mimic each other clinically but NSIP has a far better outcome. However, it remains unclear if NSIP is a truly separate and distinct entity. The histopathological pattern of NSIP can be found in a wide variety of clinical and radiological contexts. This review addresses these and other uncertainties regarding NSIP and UIP.},

For each job, exposure assessments for asbestos and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were obtained by expertise (TBQ expertise) and by algorithm using the TBQ (TBQ algorithm) as well as by expert appraisals based on all available occupational data (REFERENCE expertise) considered to be the gold standard. Additionally, a Job Exposure Matrix (JEM)-based evaluation for asbestos was also obtained. On the 497 jobs, the various evaluations were contrasted using Cohen's κ coefficient of agreement. Additionally, on the total case-control population, the asbestos dose-response relationship based on the TBQ algorithm was compared with the JEM-based assessment.Regarding asbestos, the TBQ-exposure estimates agreed well with the REFERENCE estimate (TBQ expertise: level-weighted κ (lwk)=0.68; TBQ algorithm: lwk=0.61) but less so with the JEM estimate (TBQ expertise: lwk=0.31; TBQ algorithm: lwk=0.26). Regarding PAHs, the agreements between REFERENCE expertise and TBQ were less good (TBQ expertise: lwk=0.43; TBQ algorithm: lwk=0.36). In the case-control study analysis, the dose-response relationship between lung cancer and cumulative asbestos based on the JEM is less steep than with the TBQ-algorithm exposure assessment and statistically non-significant.Asbestos-exposure estimates based on the TBQ were consistent with the REFERENCE expertise and yielded a steeper dose-response relationship than the JEM. For PAHs, results were less clear.},

Detection from cancer registry data increased to 75\% under ICD-10 in Scotland, confirming earlier predictions of the benefit of ICD-10's more specific mesothelioma codes. Including the accidental poisoning codes E866.4 (ICD-9) and X49 (ICD-10), covering poisoning by 'unspecified' and 'other' causes, which appear to have been used as coding surrogates for mesothelioma when asbestos exposure was explicitly mentioned in deaths suggestive of a mesothelioma, and which are recorded as the underlying cause of death in 4-7\% of mesotheliomas, may improve the mesothelioma detection rate in future epidemiological studies.},

  Abstract                 = {Total pulmonary nonasbestos mineral content was determined for a series of 20 patients who had no occupational dust exposure. To extract mineral fibers, lung tissue was dissolved in bleach and the treated sediment transferred to the electron microscope grid. Mineral fibers were identified using electron diffraction and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy. The mean number of nonasbestos fibers, 106 X 10(3)/g wet lung, was almost identical to the mean number of asbestos fibers, 102 X 10(3)/g. Thirteen different species or groups of nonasbestos minerals were found: apatite accounted for 18\% of the total and talc for 16\%. All other forms accounted for less than 8\% each. Silica was found in every lung, and talc in 19 of 20 lungs. Of the fibers, 86\% were shorter than 5 microns, and most of the fibers had aspect ratios less than 15. No correlations were seen between numbers or types of fibers and age, sex, or smoking. It is concluded that (1) substantial numbers of nonasbestos fibers are present in lungs of the general population. Most of these fibers are short and of low aspect ratio; and (2) by phase microscopy one is as likely to observe nonasbestos as asbestos fibers in these preparations, indicating that light microscopic methods are not suitable for this type of analysis. These data provide a baseline for comparison with patients believed to have a mineral fiber-related disease.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Objective-To assess whether the increased risk of disease related to asbestos in occupations from the con- struction and engineering industries applies equally to pleural cancer, peri- toneal cancer, and asbestosis. Methods-Analysis was based on deaths among men aged 20-74 in England and Wales during 1979-80 and 1982-90. (n = 1 656 096). Information about cause of death and the last full time occupation of decedents was derived from death certifi- cates. Proportional mortality ratios (PMRs) by occupation were calculated for each of pleural cancer, peritoneal cancer, and asbestosis. Results-Altogether, 2848 deaths were attributed to cancer of the pleura, 362 to cancer of the peritoneum, and 281 to asbestosis. When occupations were ranked according to PMRs from these diseases, striking differences were found. The category of construction workers which included laggers had the highest mortality from peritoneal cancer (PMR 990, 64 deaths), but a PMR of only 160 (77 deaths) for pleural cancer. In contrast, several occupations with much higher mortality from pleural tumours had no excess of peritoneal cancer. PMRs for asbestosis related more closely to those for peritoneal than pleural cancer. Conclusions-These findings suggest that the exposure-response relations for dis- eases related to asbestos are not all linear, and that risks of pleural mesothelioma may be underestimated by simple extrap- olation from observations in cohorts with heavy exposure.},

It is frequently converted to a percent by multiplying the ratio by 100. (PMRs) for cancer of the pleura (ICD-9 = 163), cancer of the peri- toneum (ICD-9 = 158-8 and 158-9), and asbestosis (ICD-9 = 501), PMRs for asbestosis related more closely to those for peritoneal than pleural cancer exposure-response relations for mesothelioma and asbestosis are non-linear, with the risk of pleural mesothelioma increasing relatively more steeply at low exposures but less steeply at high exposures* the risks of pleural mesothelioma may be underestimated if a linear exposure-response is assumed. This should be taken into account when control limits are reviewed.},

The relationships derived from the initial comparison were tested in a separate group of biopsy-proved UIP (n = 30) and NSIP (n = 23) cases. Two observers independently scored thin-section CT images for extent, distribution, and coarseness of fibrosis; proportion of ground-glass opacification; severity of traction bronchiectasis; and extent of emphysema.After controlling for extent of fibrosis, patients with asbestosis had coarser fibrosis than those with IPF (odds ratio, 1.52; 95\% CI: 1.25, 1.84; P <.001). Compared with the biopsy-proved cases, the asbestosis cases involved coarser fibrosis (after controlling for disease extent) than the NSIP cases (odds ratio, 2.48; 95\% CI: 1.49, 4.11; P <.001) but fibrosis similar to that in the UIP cases. A basal and subpleural distribution of disease was usual in all subgroups but significantly more prevalent (P, <.01 to.001) with asbestosis than with UIP or NSIP.The thin-section CT pattern of asbestosis closely resembles that of biopsy-proved UIP and differs markedly from that of biopsy-proved NSIP.},

  Abstract                 = {The present study reviews recent data concerning the assessment of exhaled breath condensate (EBC) pulmonary biomarkers in the field of occupational medicine.EBC is a suitable matrix to assess respiratory health status in workers exposed to pneumotoxic substances, due to its ability to quantify lung tissue dose and consequent pulmonary effects. Published data show that toxic metals and trace elements are detectable in EBC, raising the possibility of using this medium to quantify the lung tissue dose of metals occurring in occupational settings. EBC analysis of biomarkers of exposure highlighted the potential use of EBC as completion of the biological monitoring of pneumotoxic compounds. Different biomarkers of effect, such as oxidative stress and inflammatory-derived biomarkers have been applied in the investigation of occupational asthma and pneumoconiosis, suggesting that the collection of EBC may contribute to studying the pathological state of the airways of workers with acute and chronic exposure to pollutants. EBC measurements also seem to be reliable to detect the presence of carcinogenic processes in the respiratory system, by the analysis of various markers of oxidative stress, angiogenesis and DNA alterations related to lung cancer. This approach may open new frontiers in the study of workers currently or previously exposed to pulmonary carcinogenic agents.The analysis of EBC is one of the most promising methods currently available for the study of pulmonary biomarkers of exposure, effect and susceptibility in occupational settings; being collected in a totally noninvasive way, it is particularly suitable to be applied in field studies and for longitudinal assessments of pulmonary biology.},

  Abstract                 = {The etiology of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) remains poorly understood, but some studies have suggested that cigarette smoking or other occupational or environmental exposures, diabetes mellitus, or gastroesophageal reflux may play a role. In this study we evaluated the clinical records of a group of 97 consecutive patients with IPF, and 560 patients suffering 5 different respiratory disorders that were examined as controls: asthma (n=111), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (n=132), squamous cell lung carcinoma (n=118), lung adenocarcinoma (n=101) and patients with otorhinolaryngology problems but without lung disease (n=98). In bivariate analyses male sex, diabetes mellitus and being former cigarette smoker were associated with IPF. After adjusting by these variables, multivariate analysis revealed that type 2 diabetes mellitus [11.3\% in IPF patients vs 2.9\% in controls, OR=4.3 (95\% CI: 1.9-9.8), p<0.0001] was an independent risk factor associated to IPF. Our results provide additional evidence of a putative relationship between DM2 and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Experimental research is necessary for thorough assessment of the pathogenic mechanisms involved in this association.},

We confirmed association with TERT at 5p15, MUC5B at 11p15 and the 3q26 region near TERC, and we identified seven newly associated loci (Pmeta = 2.4 × 10(-8) to 1.1 × 10(-19)), including FAM13A (4q22), DSP (6p24), OBFC1 (10q24), ATP11A (13q34), DPP9 (19p13) and chromosomal regions 7q22 and 15q14-15. Our results suggest that genes involved in host defense, cell-cell adhesion and DNA repair contribute to risk of fibrotic IIPs.},

  Abstract                 = {Pet dogs with spontaneous mesothelioma were used to identify environmental exposures that might increase their owner's risk of asbestos-related disease. These animals share man's domicile environment, yet do not indulge in activities (e.g., smoking, working) which confound interpretation of epidemiologic studies. Eighteen histologically confirmed canine mesotheliomas were diagnosed at the Veterinary Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, from April 1977 to December 1981. Sixteen owners of cases and 32 owners of age, breed, and sex-matched controls were interviewed to determine their occupation and medical history and their dog's medical history, life style, diet, and exposure to asbestos. An asbestos-related occupation or hobby of a household member and use of flea repellents on the dog were significantly associated with mesothelioma. In addition, there was a trend indicating an increased risk of mesothelioma with an urban residence. Lung tissue from three dogs with mesothelioma and one dog with squamous cell carcinoma of the lung had higher levels of chrysotile asbestos fibers than lung tissue from control dogs. These findings indicate that well-designed epidemiological studies of spontaneous tumors in pet animals may provide insight into the role of environmental factors in human cancers and serve as a valuable sentinel model to identify environmental health hazards for humans.},

Postmortem samples of his lung were digested, and the inorganic material present was extracted and examined using transmission electron microscopy, electron diffraction, and electron microprobe analysis. Uncoated asbestos fibers were present (1.4 X 10(5)/g wet lung), but the surprising finding was the presence of a large number of fly ash particles (6 X 10(6)/g wet lung). Fly ash, the particulate material produced during coal combustion, has not previously been reported to be present in human lung tissue. Although the contribution of the asbestos to this man's lung disease is uncertain, we believe, based on previous studies implicating aluminum silicates in pneumoconiosis, that the fly ash, an aluminum silicate, may be a contributing factor.},

  Abstract                 = {In the course of setting up the National Mesothelioma Surveillance Program (PNSM), established in France in 1998, the question arose as to the most suitable method of assessing occupational exposure. The aim of this study was to define the most suitable rating method for assessing occupational asbestos exposure in order to assess medico-social care.The study included 100 subjects-50 cases of mesothelioma and 50 controls-randomly selected and representing 457 jobs held. Job asbestos exposure was assessed by a six-expert panel using two methods: "by job" rating, where all the jobs in were assessed regardless of the subjects; and "by subject" rating, where all the jobs of a subject were assessed at the same time. Consensus was obtained and subjects' exposure was calculated for each rating. Then, two internal experts assessed job asbestos exposure with the "by subject" rating. Kappa coefficients were used to measure agreement between the ratings.Agreement between "by job" and "by subject" ratings was very good for subject probability of exposure (kappa = 0.84) and cumulative exposure index (kappa = 0.80). Agreement between the six-expert panel and the two internal experts was good for subject exposure (kappa for probability = 0.71; kappa for cumulative exposure index= 0.68).This study shows that the two rating systems have good or very good agreement. These results validate the routine use in the PNSM of the "by subject" rating, with the advantage of being convenient and quick to provide feedback on occupational asbestos exposure to mesothelioma cases for compensation.},

  Abstract                 = {Use of control (comparison) groups is a powerful research tool. In case-control studies, controls estimate the frequency of an exposure in the population under study. Controls can be taken from known or unknown study populations. A known group consists of a defined population observed over a period, such as passengers on a cruise ship. When the study group is known, a sample of the population can be used as controls. If no population roster exists, then techniques such as random-digit dialling can be used. Sometimes, however, the study group is unknown, for example, motor-vehicle crash victims brought to an emergency department, who may come from far away. In this situation, hospital controls, neighbourhood controls, and friend, associate, or relative controls can be used. In general, one well-selected control group is better than two or more. When the number of cases is small, the ratio of controls to cases can be raised to improve the ability to find important differences. Although no ideal control group exists, readers need to think carefully about how representative the controls are. Poor choice of controls can lead to both wrong results and possible medical harm.},

  Abstract                 = {The etiology of cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis (CFA) remains largely obscure, although a 1996 report suggested an increased risk from occupational exposure to metal and wood dusts. Using data from death certificates in England and Wales, we sought evidence of any relationship between occupation and CFA and of the extent of any temporospatial clustering of place of birth and place of death as possible evidence of a geographically related environmental factor.Data on occupation and address (postal code) were obtained from certificates of men and women dying as a result of CFA between 1981 and 1990 and were compared with national mortality statistics. Place of birth data were extracted from certificates for deaths between 1993 and 1995, the only available years, and were compared with national birth statistics.Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were raised (p<0.05) in the following four occupational groups: members of the armed forces (SMR, 217.8); miners and quarrymen (SMR, 142.0); service, sports, and recreation workers (SMR, 118.6); and electrical and electronic workers (SMR, 146.6). Of these four groups, the latter group might be worth testing in a future study. There was statistical evidence of geographic clustering in postal code sectors for the recorded place of death, but the high-rate areas were different in men and women. Deaths were increased for those subjects born in urban areas, although these did not follow a clear geographic pattern.Overall, these analyses provide little evidence of any important contribution from environmental factors to the etiology of CFA and suggest that more consideration be given to alternative concepts of causation.},

  Abstract                 = {A common promoter polymorphism (rs35705950) in MUC5B, the gene encoding mucin 5B, is associated with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. It is not known whether this polymorphism is associated with interstitial lung disease in the general population.We performed a blinded assessment of interstitial lung abnormalities detected in 2633 participants in the Framingham Heart Study by means of volumetric chest computed tomography (CT). We evaluated the relationship between the abnormalities and the genotype at the rs35705950 locus.Of the 2633 chest CT scans that were evaluated, interstitial lung abnormalities were present in 177 (7\%). Participants with such abnormalities were more likely to have shortness of breath and chronic cough and reduced measures of total lung and diffusion capacity, as compared with participants without such abnormalities. After adjustment for covariates, for each copy of the minor rs35705950 allele, the odds of interstitial lung abnormalities were 2.8 times greater (95\% confidence interval [CI], 2.0 to 3.9; P<0.001), and the odds of definite CT evidence of pulmonary fibrosis were 6.3 times greater (95\% CI, 3.1 to 12.7; P<0.001). Although the evidence of an association between the MUC5B genotype and interstitial lung abnormalities was greater among participants who were older than 50 years of age, a history of cigarette smoking did not appear to influence the association.The MUC5B promoter polymorphism was found to be associated with interstitial lung disease in the general population. Although this association was more apparent in older persons, it did not appear to be influenced by cigarette smoking.

Of the 95 patients with persistent sputum, 19 (20.0%) were nonsmokers. Of the 174 men registered as having asbestosis, 56 had died, whereas the expected number of deaths among men of the same age in the Finnish general population was only 23.4. The respective figures for lung cancer were 19 observed and 2.1 expected. No excess mortality was found for other malignomas. Among men with asbestosis, the life expectancy was shorter for smokers than for non- and exsmokers.},

Age and sex distribution of the subjects revealed a high peak in their seventh decade with males predominating. The IPF rate was more than two times higher (p < 0.01) among subjects engaged in occupations that exposed them to dust or organic solvents compared with those in other jobs. To ascertain job characteristics, an autopsy-case control study was conducted using other annual volumes of the autopsy data records and a similar tendency was observed. Then, a live-case control study was undertaken of 86 subjects with IPF. A significantly higher odds ratio was noted among metal production workers and miners compared with healthy and hospital control subjects (1.37 and 1.34, respectively, p < 0.01), and also a significantly lower odds ratio among subjects who frequently eat fish. Taken together with results of recent in vitro studies, the intrapulmonary deposition of hazardous dusts, especially metallic dusts, appears to play at least a partial role in initiating IPF.},

Bronchoalveolar lavage macrophages from 22 patients have been examined. Twelve patients had occupational exposure to asbestos, talc, silica, hard metal or printing ink, while 10 had no known history of dust exposure. X-ray microprobe analysis identified particles which related to the known exposures, superimposed on a background of other particles related to smoking (kaolinite and mica) or to the general environment (silicon, titanium, and iron). The particle identification provided useful objective confirmation of the known exposures, except for silica, which could not be distinguished from the general background levels. X-ray microanalysis using BAL macrophages can be helpful for clarification of mixed dust exposures, to identify particles when light microscopy indicates retained dust in patients with no known history of exposure, and to monitor retained particles after removal from exposure.},

In 1984 the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys changed the rules on coding according to rule 3 of the World Health Organisation, so that if the cause of death was recorded as, for example, unspecified pneumonia or broncho- pneumonia in part 1 of the death certificate the disease mentioned in part 2 became the underlying cause of death. Duplicate coding of all deaths ascribed to cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis in 1984 according to the new and old rules showed a 6% increase in deaths ascribed to the disease under the new rule. Consequently the number of deaths from 1984 onwards should be scaled down by a factor of 0-94 so that the two periods are comparable. explores why mort rate increasing. more diagnosis? cf rcp map :-)x`},

  Abstract                 = {The last century experienced remarkable advances in the classification, diagnosis, and understanding of the pathogenesis of the interstitial lung diseases. Technological advances, particularly physiologic testing, lung imaging studies, bronchoalveolar lavage, surgical lung biopsy, and histopathologic assessment, improved our understanding of these entities. In particular, the advent of high-resolution computed tomography, the narrowed pathologic definition of usual interstitial pneumonia, and recognition of the prognostic importance of separating usual interstitial pneumonia from other idiopathic interstitial pneumonia patterns have profoundly changed the approach to these processes. Most recently, genetic medicine, the use of new technologies (e.g., microarrays, mass spectroscopic analysis of proteins, and laser capture microdissection), and the development of animal models have had a major impact on understanding the pathogenesis and potential molecular targets for interfering with fibrogenesis. This article highlights some of the advances and changes in clinical practice that took place in the management of patients with interstitial lung diseases over the last century.},

  Abstract                 = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a devastating, age-related lung disease of unknown cause that has few treatment options. This disease was once thought to be a chronic inflammatory process, but current evidence indicates that the fibrotic response is driven by abnormally activated alveolar epithelial cells (AECs). These cells produce mediators that induce the formation of fibroblast and myofibroblast foci through the proliferation of resident mesenchymal cells, attraction of circulating fibrocytes, and stimulation of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition. The fibroblast and myofibroblast foci secrete excessive amounts of extracellular matrix, mainly collagens, resulting in scarring and destruction of the lung architecture. The mechanisms that link idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis with ageing and aberrant epithelial activation are unknown; evidence suggests that the abnormal recapitulation of developmental pathways and epigenetic changes have a role. In this Seminar, we review recent data on the clinical course, therapeutic options, and underlying mechanisms thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.},

  Abstract                 = {The molecular pathomechanisms underlying idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) are elusive, but chronic epithelial injury has recently been suggested as key event.We investigated the possible implication of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-mediated apoptosis in sporadic IPF.We analyzed peripheral explanted lung tissues from patients with sporadic IPF (n = 24), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (n = 9), and organ donors (n = 12) for expression of major ER stress mediators and apoptosis markers by means of immunoblotting, semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry, and the TUNEL method.Compared with COPD and donor lungs, protein levels of ER stress mediators, such as processed p50 activating transcription factor (ATF)-6 and ATF-4 and the apoptosis-inductor CHOP (C/EBP-homologous protein), as well as transcript levels of spliced X-box binding protein (XBP)-1, were significantly elevated in lung homogenates and type II alveolar epithelial cells (AECIIs) of IPF lungs. Proapoptotic, oligomeric forms of Bax, which play a key role in ER stress-mediated apoptosis downstream of CHOP induction, as well as caspase-3 cleavage, could be detected in IPF lungs. By means of immunohistochemistry, exclusive induction of active ATF-6, ATF-4, and CHOP in AECIIs was encountered in IPF but not in COPD or donor lungs. Immunoreactivity was most prominent in the epithelium near dense zones of fibrosis and fibroblast foci, where these ER stress markers colocalized with markers of apoptosis (TUNEL, cleaved caspase-3).Severe ER stress response in the AECIIs of patients with sporadic IPF may underlie the apoptosis of this cell type and development of fibrosis in this disease.},

  Abstract                 = {In epidemiological questionnaire studies results can be influenced by non-responder bias. However, in respiratory epidemiology this has been analysed in very few recently published papers. The aim of our paper is to assess if the results found in our previous postal questionnaire study in an adult population in Northern Finland were biased by non-response.A random sample of 385 persons from the 1,284 non-responders in a previous postal questionnaire study was examined. The same questionnaire as in the original study was again mailed to these persons, and those still not answering were contacted by phone.Totally 183 complete answers (48\%) were collected. Lack of interest (56\%) and forgetting to mail the response letter (22\%) were the most common reasons to non-response. Typical non-responders were young men and current smokers who less frequently reported respiratory symptoms in exercise and asthma than the responders in the original study. Answers collected by phone gave for some questions higher prevalence rates than postal answers.Firstly, in this population the response rate (83.6\%) in the original study was high enough to provide reliable results for respiratory symptoms and diseases, only the prevalence of current smoking was biased by non-response. Secondly, the methods used for collecting responses in a non-response study may influence the results.},

Multiple sequential chest radiographs obtained between 1955 and 2004 in 84 workers exposed to amphiboles associated with vermiculite in the town of Libby, Montana, were studied. A panel of three NIOSH B readers reviewed each worker's longitudinal chest radiograph series in reverse chronologic order and achieved a consensus reading for each radiograph. Measures of exposure were compared between workers with and those without progression of parenchymal and pleural abnormalities.Because of the way the study was designed, all subjects had pleural (n = 84) and/or parenchymal (n = 26) abnormalities on the most recent chest radiograph. Compared with other investigations that used different methods, this investigation revealed shorter latency periods (defined as the interval between date of hire and date of earliest radiographic detection) for circumscribed pleural plaque (median latency, 8.6 years) and pleural calcification (median latency, 17.5 years). Pleural abnormalities progressed in 64 workers, while parenchymal abnormalities progressed in 14. No significant differences were found with regard to measures of exposure between workers with and those without progression.The latency period for the development of pleural plaques may be shorter than previously reported. Early plaques are subtle and may not be detectable except at retrospective review.},

  Abstract                 = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fibrotic lung disease of unknown cause characterized by relentlessly progressive restrictive-ventilatory limitation, hypoxia, dyspnea, and cough. Both the incidence and prevalence of IPF appears to be increasing, with little impact on its dismal 3-year median survival, despite two decades of clinical trials. Increasingly recognized are the serious associated comorbid illnesses, including pulmonary hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease, obstructive sleep apnea, obesity, lung cancer, and depression that further contribute to the substantial rise in the use of IPF-related healthcare resources. At present, lung transplantation remains the sole viable treatment for the few who qualify. Pharmacologic interventions targeting lung function and survival have remained largely disappointing, and very few investigations have specifically targeted comorbid conditions, symptoms, quality-of-life, and healthcare resource utilization. In reviewing the burden of illness associated with IPF, including the epidemiology, comorbidities, quality-of-life and the physical, psychosocial, and economic costs of this devastating disease, we hope to highlight some of the unmet medical needs associated with IPF, and encourage both public support and further investigations into these and other patient-centered outcomes and not just that of survival and lung function.},

However, 23\% of patients required hospitalization for a respiratory disorder and 21\% died. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis was the primary cause of death in 89\% of patients who died, and an apparent acute clinical deterioration preceded death in 47\% of these patients.The instrument used to define the pace of deterioration and cause of death was applied retrospectively.Recognition of the common occurrence of acute fatal deterioration in patients with mild to moderate IPF has important implications for monitoring patients and supports early referral for lung transplantation.},

Temporal trends in SMRs were also examined. Proportional mortality ratios (PMRs) were calculated using the Southampton (based on the 1980 standard occupational classification) coding scheme. Temporal trends in PMRs were also examined.The annual number of mesothelioma deaths has increased from 153 in 1968 to 1848 in 2001. Current deaths in males account for about 85\% of the cases. The areas of West Dunbartonshire (SMR 637), Barrow-in-Furness (593), Plymouth (396) and Portsmouth (388) have the highest SMRs over the period 1981-2000. The occupations with the highest PMRs are metal plate workers (PMR 503), vehicle body builders (526), plumbers and gas fitters (413) and carpenters (388).These data reinforce earlier findings that geographical areas and occupations associated with high exposure to asbestos in the past continue to drive the mesothelioma epidemic in Great Britain. However, the trends over time suggest a change in the balance of risk away from traditional asbestos exposure industries to industries where one could describe the exposure as secondary, such as plumbers and gas fitters, carpenters, and electricians.},

  Abstract                 = {For valid selection of subjects in "case-control" (case-referent) studies it is critical to understand that these studies do not represent an alternative to cohort studies but, rather, to census-ascertainment of the facts about the study base. Specifically, in these studies, the fact-finding scheme is to obtain a census of the study base with respect to outcome, and then a census of the cases together with a sample of the base to gather information on the determinant(s) as well as modifiers and confounders. If the base is defined a priori (primary base), then the challenge is to devise a scheme to obtain a census of the cases in it and a sample of the base itself ("control" or reference series) that is representative of it, conditional on the covariates that will be controlled in the analysis of the data. On the other hand, if the definition of the base is secondary, a corollary of the way the cases are selected, then the case series is best viewed as the totality of the cases in the base as a matter of definition. The corresponding secondary base is the population experience in which each potential case, had it occurred, would have been included in the case series. Representative sampling of a secondary base tends to call for the use of subjects coming to the source of cases because of other conditions--conditions whose occurrence is known to be unrelated to the determinant under study and whose diagnosis and referral to the source are known to have the same relation to the determinant as those of the illness under study. With both types of base, primary and secondary, the accuracy of the information on the determinant should be comparable between the case and reference series, and this requirement of comparability, just as that of representativeness, can have important implications for the selection of the study subjects.},

The characteristic findings on high-resolution computed tomography of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) are reticular abnormality and honeycombing with basal predominance. Honeycombing is a strong predictor of UIP and also is an important predictor of mortality. Because UIP carries the most adverse prognosis among the subtypes of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia, it is important to be able to differentiate this entity from nonspecific interstitial pneumonia and desquamative interstitial pneumonia from UIP, because these patients may show similar clinical presentations. A confident computed tomography diagnosis of UIP, in association with typical clinical features, will allow the clinician to avoid an unnecessary surgical biopsy.},

  Abstract                 = {A mineralogical analysis of lung tissue was conducted on 25 samples from patients who had been diagnosed as having idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) at low magnification and energy-dispersive x-ray analysis (EDXA) was used. In all samples, the surface silicon/sulfur (Si/S) ratio was calculated. The Si/S ratio for 25 samples of normal lung and 6 samples of pneumoconiotic lung was also determined (upper limit of normal Si/S ratio = 0.3). The difference between the Si/S ratio in the group with IPF and group with normal lung tissue was significantly significant (p less than .007, Wilcoxon test). Six of 12 patients with a previous diagnosis of IPF and a Si/S ratio greater than 0.3 had an exposure history that could imply inhalation of silica/silicates, and the correct diagnosis for these patients is most probably pneumoconiosis. The silica/silicate deposits detected in patients with IPF, and who had a ratio and no past exposure to dusts, could be either a cause or an effect of the disease.},

  Abstract                 = {The clinical features of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis can be indistinguishable; the need to eliminate occult environmental factors known to cause pulmonary fibrosis in patients suspected to have IPF during diagnostic evaluation is evident. We aimed to investigate occult, putative causes in the environments of patients diagnosed with IPF using tests beyond those conventionally used.In this case-cohort study, 60 consecutive patients diagnosed with IPF on the basis of the 2000 American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the European Respiratory Society (ERS) criteria were prospectively followed up every 4 months for 6 years between Jan 1, 2004, and Dec 31, 2009. At each visit a uniformly applied questionnaire was administered to these 60 patients to identify occult antigen exposure known to cause hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Patients underwent specific IgG determination, bronchoalveolar lavage, bronchial challenge testing with suspected antigens, and re-review of histopathological features in existing and subsequently obtained surgical lung biopsy samples and from lung explants. Specimens obtained from suspected sources from the patient's environment were subjected to cultures in microbiology laboratory. These clinical data and discussions among pulmonologists and radiologists familiar with IPF were used to confirm the diagnosis in accordance with 2011 ATS, ERS, Japanese Respiratory Society, and Latin American Thoracic Association guidelines; 46 of the 60 patients had IPF according to the 2011 guidelines, and our analyses in this study were focused on these 46 patients.20 of the 46 (43\%, 95\% CI 29-58) patients with IPF according to 2011 guidelines had a subsequent diagnosis of chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis: nine patients had positive bronchial challenge testing (eight of whom were also IgG positive and six of these patients also had surgical lung biopsy showing a pattern consistent with chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis); seven were IgG positive plus had histopathology on surgical lung biopsy that was consistent with hypersensitivity pneumonitis; one was IgG positive plus had greater than 20\% lymphocytes in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid; and three had findings on surgical lung biopsy that were consistent with subacute hypersensitivity pneumonitis (and IgG positive). Altogether, 29 of 46 patients diagnosed with IPF who had met the 2011 criteria had lung tissue available for histopathology (surgical lung biopsy in 28 patients and explanted lung in two patients, one of whom also had surgical biopsy) during the study period, and 16 of the 20 patients with chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis had histopathological features on surgical lung biopsy that were consistent with this diagnosis. 26 of the 46 patients remained with a diagnosis of IPF.Almost half of patients diagnosed with IPF on the basis of 2011 criteria were subsequently diagnosed with chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and most of these cases were attributed to exposure of occult avian antigens from commonly used feather bedding. Our results reflect findings in one centre with recognised expertise in chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and further research and studies at other centres are warranted.Fondo de Investigaciones Sanitarias; Fundació Privada Cellex; SEPAR 2010.},

All cases in the practice of two pulmonary specialists were identified. Cases were excluded if they were thought to have occupational exposures as a contributor, hypersensitivity pneumonitis or sarcoidosis, or some other well-recognized cause. Three controls were matched by sex and age (one year) as identified through orthopedic surgeons at the same institutions. Two rounds of a questionnaire were mailed; 17 cases (37.7\%) and 94 controls (32.4\%) responded to the questionnaire, although many of the case addresses were no longer valid. Individuals with ILD were 16.0 times as likely to report mold exposure and 11.1 times as likely to report silica as were controls in their workplace. Odds ratios associating ILD with moisture indicators in the home were in the same range as previously published associations between such indicators and wheezing. ILD may have environmental and occupational causes that warrant more systematic exploration.},

  Review                   = {1. Using ONS data: Over this period of time, three different ICD (International Classification of Diseases) codes were used to code death from IPF-CS. From 1965 to 1978, ICD-8 code 517 (other chronic interstitial pneumonia) From 1979 to 1999, ICD-9 codes 516.3 (idiopathic fibrosing alveolitis) and 515 (postinflammatory fibrosis) From 2000 onwards, ICD-10 code J84.1 (idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis) From 2010 onwards ICD-10 code Used population from England and Wales for each year for the years 1968-2008 as our denominators. For these analyses, the data on registered deaths and the general population were grouped into 5 year age bands over the age of 55 years and calendar periods were grouped into 5 year periods, but without combining years with different ICD codes. We calculated age- and sex stratum-specific mortality rates for each year and then applied these rates to the 2008 population to generate annual standardised mortality numbers. Poisson regression modelling was used to estimate annual mortality rate ratios with adjustment for sex and age. 2. Using THIN data: We calculated crude annual incidence rates, stratified by sex and age in 5 year age bands over the age of 55 years. Poisson regression modelling was applied to estimate annual incidence rate ratios, controlling for age, sex and health authority. 3. Survival analysis, individuals with IPF-CS were assigned a start date that was defined as the date of diagnosis and a stop date that was defined as the earliest of either the last THIN data collection or the date of death. In order to determine if mortality was changing over time, we calculated the median survival for this cohort overall and survival stratified by 2 year calendar periods using KaplaneMeir methods. Cox regression was used to compare mortality rates between the different age groups, sex and calendar periods. Multiplicative interaction terms were applied to test for interactions between mortality rates in the different calendar periods and age or sex},

  Abstract                 = {Laboratory studies suggest that the clotting cascade is activated in fibrotic lungs. Since humans vary in their tendency to clot due to a variety of inherited or acquired defects, we investigated whether a prothrombotic state increases the chance of developing idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and/or worsens the prognosis of IPF.We recruited 211 incident cases of IPF and 256 age- and sex-matched general population controls and collected data on medical history, medication, smoking habit, blood samples as well as lung function and high-resolution CT scans done as part of routine clinical care. A prothrombotic state was defined as the presence of at least one inherited or acquired clotting defect or marker of fibrinolytic dysfunction. We used logistic regression to quantify the association between a prothrombotic state and IPF adjusted for age, sex, smoking habit and highly sensitive C reactive protein. Cox regression was used to determine the influence of a prothrombotic state on survival.Cases were more than four times more likely than controls to have a prothrombotic state (OR 4.78, 95\% CI 2.93 to 7.80; p<0.0001). Cases with a prothrombotic state were also likely to have more severe disease (forced vital capacity <70\% predicted) at presentation (OR 10.79, 95\% CI 2.43 to 47.91) and had a threefold increased risk of death (HR 3.26, 95\% CI 1.09 to 9.75).People with IPF are more likely to have a prothrombotic state than general population controls and the presence of a prothrombotic state has an adverse impact on survival.},

  Abstract                 = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating disease that probably involves several genetic loci. Several rare genetic variants and one common single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of MUC5B have been associated with the disease. Our aim was to identify additional common variants associated with susceptibility and ultimately mortality in IPF.First, we did a three-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS): stage one was a discovery GWAS; and stages two and three were independent case-control studies. DNA samples from European-American patients with IPF meeting standard criteria were obtained from several US centres for each stage. Data for European-American control individuals for stage one were gathered from the database of genotypes and phenotypes; additional control individuals were recruited at the University of Pittsburgh to increase the number. For controls in stages two and three, we gathered data for additional sex-matched European-American control individuals who had been recruited in another study. DNA samples from patients and from control individuals were genotyped to identify SNPs associated with IPF. SNPs identified in stage one were carried forward to stage two, and those that achieved genome-wide significance (p<5?×?10(-8)) in a meta-analysis were carried forward to stage three. Three case series with follow-up data were selected from stages one and two of the GWAS using samples with follow-up data. Mortality analyses were done in these case series to assess the SNPs associated with IPF that had achieved genome-wide significance in the meta-analysis of stages one and two. Finally, we obtained gene-expression profiling data for lungs of patients with IPF from the Lung Genomics Research Consortium and analysed correlation with SNP genotypes.In stage one of the GWAS (542 patients with IPF, 542 control individuals matched one-by-one to cases by genetic ancestry estimates), we identified 20 loci. Six SNPs reached genome-wide significance in stage two (544 patients, 687 control individuals): three TOLLIP SNPs (rs111521887, rs5743894, rs5743890) and one MUC5B SNP (rs35705950) at 11p15.5; one MDGA2 SNP (rs7144383) at 14q21.3; and one SPPL2C SNP (rs17690703) at 17q21.31. Stage three (324 patients, 702 control individuals) confirmed the associations for all these SNPs, except for rs7144383. Linkage disequilibrium between the MUC5B SNP (rs35705950) and TOLLIP SNPs (rs111521887 [r(2)=0·07], rs5743894 [r(2)=0·16], and rs5743890 [r(2)=0·01]) was low. 683 patients from the GWAS were included in the mortality analysis. Individuals who developed IPF despite having the protective TOLLIP minor allele of rs5743890 carried an increased mortality risk (meta-analysis with fixed-effect model: hazard ratio 1·72 [95\% CI 1·24-2·38]; p=0·0012). TOLLIP expression was decreased by 20\% in individuals carrying the minor allele of rs5743890 (p=0·097), 40\% in those with the minor allele of rs111521887 (p=3·0?×?10(-4)), and 50\% in those with the minor allele of rs5743894 (p=2·93?×?10(-5)) compared with homozygous carriers of common alleles for these SNPs.Novel variants in TOLLIP and SPPL2C are associated with IPF susceptibility. One novel variant of TOLLIP, rs5743890, is also associated with mortality. These associations and the reduced expression of TOLLIP in patients with IPF who carry TOLLIP SNPs emphasise the importance of this gene in the disease.National Institutes of Health; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; Pulmonary Fibrosis Foundation; Coalition for Pulmonary Fibrosis; and Instituto de Salud Carlos III.},

  Abstract                 = {To determine patterns in asbestos-induced lung diseases found in older, less exposed workers.Review of a database evaluating lung function, smoking status, form of asbestos-induced lung disease, and radiograph abnormalities.Outpatient clinic.A total of 3383 asbestos-exposed workers referred for independent medical evaluation, including control subjects who lacked asbestos-specific radiograph abnormalities (n = 243), subjects with low International Labor Organization (ILO) scores (n = 2,685), high ILO scores (n = 312), bronchogenic cancer (n = 63), and mesothelioma (n = 80). Of these, 3,327 workers have specific smoking status information and 3,312 workers have lung volume measures.Chest radiographs were interpreted by a certified B-reader, and abnormalities were quantified according to the ILO scoring system. Spirometry and lung volume measurement were performed. Subjects completed a self-administered questionnaire that was reviewed at the time of examination. Control subjects were screened on two separate occasions at least 10 years apart to exclude subclinical or slowly progressive asbestos-induced lung disease.The mean age of the population was 65.1 +/- 9.9 years, and the latency was 41.4 +/- 10.1 years (+/- SD). Most subjects (41.8\%) had normal pulmonary function. Obstruction was the most common pulmonary function abnormality (25.4\%), followed by restriction (19.3\%) and a mixed pattern (6.0\%). Most subjects (79.4\%) had low ILO scores. Benign pleural abnormalities were the only findings in 54\% of subjects with low ILO score. Subjects with high ILO scores were older, smoked more, and had a longer latency than subjects with low ILO scores and control subjects. Smokers were younger, had a shorter latency, and had paradoxically greater ILO scores than nonsmokers. Subjects with bronchogenic cancer and mesothelioma had longer latencies than control subjects and subjects with benign asbestos-induced lung disease.Asbestos-induced lung disease today is characterized by low ILO scores, long latencies, greater disease magnitude in smokers, and a normal or obstructive pattern of pulmonary function abnormality. Spirometric evaluation in the absence of lung volume measurements caused misclassification that resulted in overestimation of the presence of a restrictive pattern of pulmonary function.},

  Abstract                 = {We followed a group of 85 Finnish asbestosis patients radiographically for an average of 6.5 (range 2-10) years to examine the progression of the disease and to assess possible explanations for the progression.The examinations included full-size chest radiographs and a blood specimen analysis. The radiographs were classified according to the 1980 International Labor Office (ILO) classification. Progression was accepted if the second or third radiography was estimated (in a side-by-side comparison) to have more profusion of small opacities qualitatively than the first, even if the radiographs were classified into the same profusion category.In all, 38\% of the patients showed progression during the follow-up period. The average progression of small opacities ranged from ILO 1/1 to ILO 2/2 (0.4 minor ILO categories/year). The asbestosis was progressive more often among the sprayers than among the insulators and asbestos factory workers [cross-tabulation, odds ratio (OR) 5.0, 95\% confidence interval (95\% CI) 1.2-20]. In the logistic regression model the ILO classification category at the beginning of the follow-up (OR 1.54; 95\% CI 0.96-2.47), the fibronectin (OR 1.01; 95\% CI 1.00-1.01) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE; OR 1.10; 95\% CI 1.00-1.20) levels, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR; OR 1.05; 95\% CI 1.00-1.10) were statistically associated with the radiographic progression of small opacities. Abnormalities of the pleura were found to progress more often among the patients with progressive parenchymal opacities.For the progression of small-opacity profusion the significant predictors in the logistic regression model were the ILO profusion category at the beginning of the follow-up period, the fibronectin level, the ACE value, and the ESR. The model correctly classified 94\% of the patients with progression and 65\% of those without progression. The differences in the mean values recorded for the biomarkers between the progressors and nonprogressors, however, were small and may therefore not be of any importance to the clinician.},

  Abstract                 = {National analyses of mortality in England and Wales have repeatedly shown excess deaths from pneumonia in welders. During 1979-90 the excess was attributable largely to deaths from lobar pneumonia and pneumonias other than bronchopneumonia, limited to men of working age and apparent in other occupations with exposure to metal fumes. The findings for 1991-2000 were assessed and compared with the mortality pattern from asthma in occupations exposed to known respiratory sensitisers.The Office of National Statistics supplied data on deaths by underlying cause among men aged 16-74 years in England and Wales during 1991-2000, including age and last held occupation. Data were abstracted on pneumonia for occupations with exposure to metal fumes and on asthma for occupations commonly reported to surveillance schemes as at risk of occupational asthma. The expected numbers of deaths were estimated by applying age-specific proportions of deaths by cause in the population to the total deaths by age in each occupational group. Observed and expected numbers were compared for each cause of death.Among men of working age in occupations with exposure to metal fumes there was excess mortality from pneumococcal and lobar pneumonia (54 deaths vs 27.3 expected) and from pneumonias other than bronchopneumonia (71 vs 52.4), but no excess from these causes at older ages or from bronchopneumonia at any age. The attributable mortality from metal fume exposure was 45.3 excess deaths compared with an estimated 62.6 deaths from occupational asthma.Exposure to metal fumes is a material cause of occupational mortality. The hazard deserves far more attention than it presently receives.},

  Abstract                 = {To test the hypothesis that inhalation of metal fume reversibly increases susceptibility to pneumonia, the authors conducted a case-control study. Men aged 20-64 years, admitted to 11 hospitals in West Midlands, England, with community-acquired pneumonia during 1996-1999 were interviewed about their lifetime occupational history, exposure to metal fume, and potential confounding factors. Similar information was collected from controls admitted to the same hospitals with nonrespiratory illness. For cases, exposures were timed relative to the onset of their illness (on average, 6 months before interview). Exposure histories for controls were censored 6 months before interview. Interviews were completed by 525 cases and 1,122 controls (response rates of 74\% and 99\%). Pneumonia was associated with reported occupational exposure to metal fume in the previous year (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 1.6, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.1, 2.4) but not in earlier periods (OR = 1.1). The risk was highest for lobar pneumonia and recent exposure to ferrous fume (OR = 2.3, 95\% CI: 1.2, 4.3). The association was not specific to any one microorganism. These findings support the hypothesis that ferrous and possibly other metal fumes reversibly predispose to infectious pneumonia. Research should now focus on the underlying mechanisms and prevention.},

  Abstract                 = {Metal and wood dust exposures have been identified as possible occupational risk factors for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). We analyzed mortality data using ICD-10 code J84.1--"Other interstitial pulmonary diseases with fibrosis," derived age-adjusted mortality rates for 1999-2003, and assessed occupational risks for 1999, by calculating proportionate mortality ratios (PMRs) and mortality odds ratios (MORs) using a matched case-control approach. We identified 84,010 IPF deaths, with an age-adjusted mortality rate of 75.7 deaths/million. Mortality rates were highest among males, whites, and those aged 85 and older. Three industry categories with potential occupational exposures recognized as risk factors for IPF were identified: "Wood buildings and mobile homes" (PMR = 4.5, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.2-11.6 and MOR = 5.3, 95\% CI 1.2-23.8), "Metal mining" (PMR = 2.4, 95\% CI 1.3-4.0 and MOR = 2.2, 95\% CI 1.1-4.4), and "Fabricated structural metal products" (PMR = 1.9, 95\% CI 1.1-3.1 and MOR = 1.7, 95\% CI 1.0-3.1). Workers in these industry categories may benefit from toxicological studies and improved surveillance for this disease.},

Male ORs (95\% confidence interval (CI)) relative to low-risk occupations for >10 years of exposure before the age of 30 years were 50.0 (25.8-96.8) for carpenters (LR 1 in 17), 17.1 (10.3-28.3) for plumbers, electricians and painters, 7.0 (3.2-15.2) for other construction workers, 15.3 (9.0-26.2) for other recognised high-risk occupations and 5.2 (3.1-8.5) in other industries where asbestos may be encountered. The LR was similar in apparently unexposed men and women (approximately 1 in 1000), and this was approximately doubled in exposed workers' relatives (OR 2.0, 95\% CI 1.3-3.2). No other environmental hazards were identified. In all, 14\% of male and 62\% of female cases were not attributable to occupational or domestic asbestos exposure. Approximately half of the male cases were construction workers, and only four had worked for more than 5 years in asbestos product manufacture.},

  Abstract                 = {Asbestosis is defined as diffuse pulmonary fibrosis caused by the inhalation of excessive amounts of asbestos fibers. Pathologically, both pulmonary fibrosis of a particular pattern and evidence of excess asbestos in the lungs must be present. Clinically, the disease usually progresses slowly, with a typical latent period of more than 20 years from first exposure to onset of symptoms.IDIOPATHIC PULMONARY FIBROSIS: The pulmonary fibrosis of asbestosis is interstitial and has a basal subpleural distribution, similar to that seen in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, which is the principal differential diagnosis. However, there are differences between the 2 diseases apart from the presence or absence of asbestos. First, the interstitial fibrosis of asbestosis is accompanied by very little inflammation, which, although not marked, is better developed in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Second, in keeping with the slow tempo of the disease, the fibroblastic foci that characterize idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis are infrequent in asbestosis. Third, asbestosis is almost always accompanied by mild fibrosis of the visceral pleura, a feature that is rare in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.RESPIRATORY BRONCHIOLITIS: Asbestosis is believed to start in the region of the respiratory bronchiole and gradually extends outward to involve more and more of the lung acinus, until the separate foci of fibrosis link, resulting in the characteristically diffuse pattern of the disease. These early stages of the disease are diagnostically problematic because similar centriacinar fibrosis is often seen in cigarette smokers and is characteristic of mixed-dust pneumoconiosis. Fibrosis limited to the walls of the bronchioles does not represent asbestosis.Histologic evidence of asbestos inhalation is provided by the identification of asbestos bodies either lying freely in the air spaces or embedded in the interstitial fibrosis. Asbestos bodies are distinguished from other ferruginous bodies by their thin, transparent core. Two or more asbestos bodies per square centimeter of a 5- mu m-thick lung section, in combination with interstitial fibrosis of the appropriate pattern, are indicative of asbestosis. Fewer asbestos bodies do not necessarily exclude a diagnosis of asbestosis, but evidence of excess asbestos would then require quantitative studies performed on lung digests.Quantification of asbestos load may be performed on lung digests or bronchoalveolar lavage material, employing either light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, or transmission electron microscopy. Whichever technique is employed, the results are only dependable if the laboratory is well practiced in the method chosen, frequently performs such analyses, and the results are compared with those obtained by the same laboratory applying the same technique to a control population.},

  Review                   = {An important differential diagnosis that arises in cases of asbestosis?especially when there is clinical-radiologic controversy about the diagnosis?is determining whether the disorder represents asbestosis or another interstitial disorder, such as one of the idiopathic interstitial pneumonias, especially UIP. One point of distinction is that UIP tends to be more rapidly progressive than asbestosis, which is usually either static or only slowly progressive,69 although cases of rapidly progressive asbestosis do occur.72 About 50% or fewer cases progress after cessation of asbestos exposure.67 Clinical asbestosis can be induced by cumulative asbestos exposure amounting to an estimated 25 fibers/ ml?yrs,31,67 and Browne73 and Churg74 have indicated that a ??dose?? in the range of 25 to 100 fibers/ml?yrs is required for the development of asbestosis. One Chinese study,75 based on chest radiographs of workers involved in the manufacture of asbestos products, found a 1% prevalence of grade I asbestosis (according to the Chinese system of grading), at a cumulative exposure of 22 fibers/ml?yrs. Green et al,76 in an autopsy study on the South Carolina asbestos textile workers, reported that histologic asbesto- sis was usually detectable with exposures in excess of 20 fibers/ml?yrs, and a few cases were found with estimated cumulative exposures of 10?20 fibers/ml?yrs (histologic examination being the most sensitive and specific means for the diagnosis of asbestosis). From an analysis of cases in the German Mesothelioma Register, Fischer et al77 reported that a requirement for asbestos exposure amounting to 25 fibers/ml?yrs for the diagnosis of asbestosis?including minimal histologic asbestosis? would lead to underrecognition of 42% of asbestosis cases and false-positive diagnoses in 24%.

  Abstract                 = {Asbestos exposure has resulted in a variety of diseases, including asbestosis, carcinoma of the lung (LC), pleural plaques, and malignant mesothelioma (MM). We hypothesized that there have been significant changes in the mineral fiber content of lung tissue from individuals with these diseases over the past 25 years. Asbestos content was measured in lung tissue samples from 819 individuals using light microscopy (to measure asbestos body concentrations) and scanning electron microscopy (to measure types and concentrations of mineral fibers). Cases were divided chronologically according to those occurring in the first half (group 1) versus those occurring in the second half (group 2). The study included 419 cases of MM, 206 cases of asbestosis, and 340 cases of LC. The median asbestos body count (in asbestos bodies per gram) decreased from group 1 to group 2 for each disease: MM, 480 to 350; asbestosis, 24700 to 19200; and LC, 1600 to 174 (reference range, 0-20). A similar trend was observed for fiber counts by scanning electron microscopy. Amosite was the most frequently detected asbestos fiber type and decreased in frequency of detection and median concentration from group 1 to group 2. Crocidolite showed an increased detection frequency from group 1 to group 2 across all 3 disease categories. The decrease in asbestos body and amosite concentrations over time is consistent with the banning of asbestos from insulation products in 1972. The source for the increased detection of crocidolite was not identified and needs further investigation.},

This article reports further results pertaining to response to treatment and survival.Data on the treatment given and lung function response were collected over 4-6 years. Survival data were collected over 10 years.Treatment was given to 445 (76\%) patients, 55\% were given prednisolone alone and the remainder another immunosuppressive agent, usually with prednisolone. Treated patients had worse lung function initially. At 3 months after study entry, treated patients were more likely to have improved forced vital capacity (FVC) than the untreated patients. Patients whose FVC improved were younger (p = 0.001 analysis of variance (ANOVA)) and had lower initial FVC (p<0.001, ANOVA). Patients who responded to treatment at 3 months or at 1 year survived longer than those who remained stable, who in turn survived longer than those who deteriorated (p = 0.002). These differences were largely accounted for by patients with better lung function surviving longer. Younger age at entry, female sex and higher percentage predicted FVC and carbon monoxide transfer factor [corrected] at study entry were associated with greater chances of survival at 4 years. Overall median survival from entry was 2.43 years (95\% confidence interval (CI) 2.17 to 3.18).About a third of patients with CFA showed improved lung function after initiation of corticosteroid or immunosuppressive treatment, and those who improved survived longer. Poorer lung function, male sex and age are adverse prognostic features. Overall survival was poor.},

We evaluated airway and parenchymal pathology using standardized diagnostic criteria and semiquantitative grading schemata, including the grading of small airways for fibrosis and birefringent mineral dust particles. We analyzed lung dust burden on a subset of 37 lungs following bleach digestion, using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray spectrometry (XRS) and image analysis, and by X-ray diffraction for crystalline silica (CSi). Farmworkers comprised 51.5\% and nonfarmworkers 48.5\% of the samples.Proximal airways demonstrated little mineral dust accumulation, but membranous and respiratory bronchioles had wall thickening, remodeling, and inflammation associated with carbonaceous and mineral dust deposition. These changes were independently associated with agricultural work, cigarette smoking, and increased age. Mineral dust small airways disease, pneumoconiosis (macules and nodules), and pathologic changes consistent with chronic bronchitis, emphysema, and interstitial fibrosis predominated in farmworkers compared with nonfarmworkers. CSi, determined gravimetrically, and aluminum silicate particles, determined by SEM/XRS, were increased in the lungs of farmworkers compared with nonfarmworkers and were significantly (p < 0.05) associated with small airway disease and pneumoconiosis.Mineral dust exposure is associated with increased small airway disease and pneumoconiosis among California farmworkers; however, the clinical significance and natural history of these changes remains to be determined.},

  Abstract                 = {The mutations that have been implicated in pulmonary fibrosis account for only a small proportion of the population risk.Using a genomewide linkage scan, we detected linkage between idiopathic interstitial pneumonia and a 3.4-Mb region of chromosome 11p15 in 82 families. We then evaluated genetic variation in this region in gel-forming mucin genes expressed in the lung among 83 subjects with familial interstitial pneumonia, 492 subjects with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and 322 controls. MUC5B expression was assessed in lung tissue.Linkage and fine mapping were used to identify a region of interest on the p-terminus of chromosome 11 that included gel-forming mucin genes. The minor-allele of the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs35705950, located 3 kb upstream of the MUC5B transcription start site, was present at a frequency of 34\% among subjects with familial interstitial pneumonia, 38\% among subjects with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and 9\% among controls (allelic association with familial interstitial pneumonia, P=1.2×10(-15); allelic association with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, P=2.5×10(-37)). The odds ratios for disease among subjects who were heterozygous and those who were homozygous for the minor allele of this SNP were 6.8 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 3.9 to 12.0) and 20.8 (95\% CI, 3.8 to 113.7), respectively, for familial interstitial pneumonia and 9.0 (95\% CI, 6.2 to 13.1) and 21.8 (95\% CI, 5.1 to 93.5), respectively, for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. MUC5B expression in the lung was 14.1 times as high in subjects who had idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis as in those who did not (P<0.001). The variant allele of rs35705950 was associated with up-regulation in MUC5B expression in the lung in unaffected subjects (expression was 37.4 times as high as in unaffected subjects homozygous for the wild-type allele, P<0.001). MUC5B protein was expressed in lesions of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.A common polymorphism in the promoter of MUC5B is associated with familial interstitial pneumonia and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Our findings suggest that dysregulated MUC5B expression in the lung may be involved in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis. (Funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and others.).},

Significant predictors of disease progression were found by a linear stepwise regression analysis from among such variables as smoking history, latency (time since first exposure), duration and intensity of exposure, and cytology.Although most radiographs remained normal, some showed progression of disease with about twice as many patients with abnormalities on the last film. Various combinations of age, intensity of exposure, and time between films were significant predictors of pleural and parenchymal disease and progression of such disease. No predominance of one sided disease was noted. Cytology and smoking were unreliable predictors of disease. Most disease progression was minor, usually of less than two scoring categories.An intense, yet short, exposure to amosite asbestos can produce pleural and parenchymal changes on chest radiographs. The number of those affected roughly doubled over a period spanning 10 to 20 years after exposure. Age and intensity of exposure are the most important predictors of disease.},

Chest radiographs revealed both small rounded and small irregular opacities. Small irregular opacities on chest radiographs often proved to be reticular or honeycomb patterns on CT scans. Irregular opacities seen on CR and CT images represented interstitial fibrotic or mixed dust fibrotic changes associated with the accumulation of birefringent particles and emphysematous change, as noted at histologic analysis. CT scans and scintigrams were useful for visualizing parenchymal abnormalities, especially fibrotic change, emphysematous change, and pleural abnormalities.},

Survivors were offered a follow-up evaluation.Morbidity and mortality related to AEP.There were 18 cases of AEP identified among 183,000 military personnel deployed in or near Iraq during the study period, yielding an AEP incidence of 9.1 per 100,000 person-years (95\% confidence interval, 4.3-13.3). The majority of patients (89\%) were men and the median age was 22 (range, 19-47) years. All patients used tobacco, with 78\% recently beginning to smoke. All but 1 reported significant exposure to fine airborne sand or dust. Known causes of pulmonary eosinophilia (eg, drug exposures or parasitic disease) were not identified. Epidemiologic investigation revealed no evidence of a common source exposure, temporal or geographic clustering, person-to-person transmission, or an association with recent vaccination. Six patients underwent bronchoalveolar lavage (median eosinophilia of 40.5\%). All patients developed peripheral eosinophilia (range, 8\%-42\%). Mechanical ventilation was required in 67\% for a median of 7 (range, 2-16) days. Two soldiers died; the remainder responded to corticosteroids and/or supportive care. Twelve individuals were reevaluated a median of 3 months after diagnosis. At that point, 3 patients reported mild dyspnea and 1 reported wheezing. All patients had finished treatment and had either normal or nearly normal spirometry results. None had recurrent eosinophilia.AEP occurred at an increased rate among this deployed military population and resulted in 2 deaths. Failure to consider AEP in the differential diagnosis of respiratory failure in military personnel can result in missing this syndrome and possibly death. The etiology of AEP remains unclear, but the association with new-onset smoking suggests a possible link.},

There was HIPAA compliance for all U.S. patients. The study included 66 patients (36 men, 30 women; mean age, 58.8 years +/- 10.9 [standard deviation]) with proved chronic HP (n = 18), IPF (n = 23), or NSIP (n = 25) who underwent CT. Two independent readers assessed the CT images, made a first-choice diagnosis, and noted the degree of confidence in the diagnosis. A general linear model was used to identify CT features that independently differentiated chronic HP from IPF and NSIP. Weighted kappa statistic was used to assess interobserver agreement.The CT features that best differentiated chronic HP were lobular areas with decreased attenuation and vascularity, centrilobular nodules, and absence of lower zone predominance of abnormalities (P < or = .008). The features that best differentiated NSIP were relative subpleural sparing, absence of lobular areas with decreased attenuation, and lack of honeycombing (P < or = .002). The features that best differentiated IPF were basal predominance of honeycombing, absence of relative subpleural sparing, and absence centrilobular nodules (P < or = .004). A confident diagnosis was made in 70 (53\%) of 132 readings. This diagnosis was correct in 66 (94\%) of 70 readings. The accuracy for the entire cohort was 80\%. Interobserver agreement for confident diagnosis was good to excellent (kappa = 0.77-0.96).Characteristic CT features of chronic HP, IPF, and NSIP allow confident distinction between these entities in approximately 50\% of patients.},

The World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated that 107,000 people worldwide die each year from mesothelioma, lung cancer, and asbestosis. We review what is known about asbestos use, production, and exposure and asbestos-related diseases in the world today, and we offer predictions for the future. Although worldwide consumption of asbestos has decreased, consumption is increasing in many developing countries. The limited data available suggest that exposures may also be high in developing countries. Mesothelioma is still increasing in most European countries and in Japan but has peaked in the United States and Sweden. Although the epidemic of asbestos-related disease has plateaued or is expected to plateau in most of the developed world, little is known about the epidemic in developing countries. It is obvious that increased asbestos use by these countries will result in an increase in asbestos-related diseases in the future.},

The patients' ages ranged from 45 to 74 years at the time of study. None of the patients had asbestosis. The distribution of fibres and dust content of the lungs showed a log-normal distribution. There was no significant difference in fibre counts or dust content between men and women, and between lung cancer and non-cancer patients. The only group with an association with a high asbestos fibre count was four necropsy cases of pleural mesothelioma. There was no significant relationship between asbestos fibre count and dust content of the lung. The present data suggest that asbestos fibre counts below 100,000 per gram of dried lung are not related to specific asbestos disease, although in the surgical cases who were closely questioned on their residential and occupational histories most of those with fibre counts above 30,000 per gram dried lung had had occasions of definite or very likely asbestos exposure.},

  Abstract                 = {Of the idiopathic lung diseases, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and sarcoidosis have been the focus of a growing number of epidemiological investigations on the risk of environmental and occupational exposures. To date, the consistency of epidemiological evidence is suggestive of a causal relationship between several environmental exposures and IPF, with the strongest evidence for cigarette smoking and metal dust. Current knowledge about pathogenesis provides further support for a causal link. However, scant epidemiological evidence for dose-response and temporality weaken the case for making causal inferences. In contrast to IPF, the quantity of epidemiological evidence for environmental exposures and sarcoidosis is smaller. Two studies provide consistent evidence for exposures to agricultural dust and musty odor/mold/mildew, and studies among military personnel and firefighters suggest mixed dust and fume exposures as risk factors for sarcoidosis. Although studies of the pathogenesis of sarcoidosis also provide evidence supporting environmental causation, more epidemiological studies are needed to establish consistency of associations, dose-response, and temporality. Future investigations, of gene-environment interaction offer the potential for strengthening the evidence of causation between several environmental and occupational exposures and idiopathic lung diseases.},

Given the variable quality of current exposure assessment techniques, we suggest methods to improve assessments, including the incorporation of hygiene measurements: using data from administrative exposure databases; using results of studies identifying determinants of exposure to develop questionnaires; and where reasonable given latency and biological half life considerations, directly measuring exposures of study subjects.},

  Abstract                 = {In 2002 the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society (ATS/ERS) classification of idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IIPs) defined seven specific entities, and provided standardized terminology and diagnostic criteria. In addition, the historical "gold standard" of histologic diagnosis was replaced by a multidisciplinary approach. Since 2002 many publications have provided new information about IIPs.The objective of this statement is to update the 2002 ATS/ERS classification of IIPs.An international multidisciplinary panel was formed and developed key questions that were addressed through a review of the literature published between 2000 and 2011.Substantial progress has been made in IIPs since the previous classification. Nonspecific interstitial pneumonia is now better defined. Respiratory bronchiolitis-interstitial lung disease is now commonly diagnosed without surgical biopsy. The clinical course of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and nonspecific interstitial pneumonia is recognized to be heterogeneous. Acute exacerbation of IIPs is now well defined. A substantial percentage of patients with IIP are difficult to classify, often due to mixed patterns of lung injury. A classification based on observed disease behavior is proposed for patients who are difficult to classify or for entities with heterogeneity in clinical course. A group of rare entities, including pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis and rare histologic patterns, is introduced. The rapidly evolving field of molecular markers is reviewed with the intent of promoting additional investigations that may help in determining diagnosis, and potentially prognosis and treatment.This update is a supplement to the previous 2002 IIP classification document. It outlines advances in the past decade and potential areas for future investigation.},

  Abstract                 = {The history of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) shows that the disease may be preceded by a viral-like illness. Although viruses have not been demonstrated, it is possible that viruses were not detected in culture because they do not replicate during latency. We investigated the presence of adenovirus in IPF and interstitial pneumonia associated with collagen vascular disease (CVD-IP), using the nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and in situ hybridization (ISH) for the E1A region of the adenovirus genome. Studies were performed on lung tissues obtained by transbronchial lung biopsy from 19 patients with IPF, 10 patients with CVD-IP and, for comparison, 20 patients with sarcoidosis. The E1A DNA was present in 3 out of 19 (16%) cases of IPF, in 5 of 10 (50%) cases of CVD-IP, and in 2 of 20 (10%) cases of sarcoidosis. The incidence of E1A DNA in CVD-IP was significantly higher than that in sarcoidosis (p < 0.05). In patients with IPF and CVD-IP, E1A DNA was more prevalent in patients treated with corticosteroids (6 out of 9 cases; 67%) than in those without it (2 out of 20 cases; 10%) (p < 0.01). ISH studies showed that 1 out of 8 cases of IPF and CVD-IP, in which E1A DNA was detected by PCR, was positive for E1A DNA. We conclude that adenovirus E1A is unlikely to be aetiologically involved in the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis or interstitial pneumonia associated with collagen vascular disease. However, a latent adenovirus infection may be reactivated or may newly infect the host following corticosteroid administration.},

  Abstract                 = {Several clinical trials have recently targeted specific pathways implicated in the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). However, IPF remains plagued by a median survival of 3 yrs and emphasises the need for further research with new insights and perspectives. The prevailing pathogenic hypotheses assume that either an inflammatory process or an independent epithelial/fibroblastic disorder may propagate the disease process. Based on knowledge developed with considerable scientific evidence, we provide our perspectives with an alternative point of view that IPF be considered as a neoproliferative disorder of the lung. Genetic alterations, response to growth and inhibitory signals, resistance to apoptosis, myofibroblast origin and behaviour, altered cellular communications, and intracellular signalling pathways are all fundamental pathogenic hallmarks of both IPF and cancer. The concept of IPF as a lethal malignant disorder of the lung might extend beyond the pathogenic link between these two diseases and disclose new pathogenic mechanisms leading to novel therapeutic options, adopted from cancer biology. Moreover, this vision might dawn the awareness of the public, political and scientific community of this devastating disease from an angle different from the current perception and provoke new ideas and studies to get a better understanding to control the otherwise relentless progressive disease.},

Wacholder et al. Am J Epidemiol 1992;135:1029-50). In this paper, a theoretical framework for selecting controls in case-control studies is developed. Three principles of comparability are described: 1) study base, that all comparisons be made within the study base; 2) deconfounding, that comparisons of the effects of the levels of exposure on disease risk not be distorted by the effects of other factors; and 3) comparable accuracy, that any errors in measurement of exposure be nondifferential between cases and controls. These principles, if adhered to in a study, can reduce selection, confounding, and information bias, respectively. The principles, however, are constrained by an additional efficiency principle regarding resources and time. Most problems and controversies in control selection reflect trade-offs among these four principles.},

  Abstract                 = {In the period 1966-82 lungs from 333 workers who had been employed at a Royal Naval dockyard were referred to the MRC Pneumoconiosis Unit where they were investigated for the severity of asbestosis, the presence of tumours, and an assessment of mineral fibre content and the type and amount of mineral present. The occupational exposure to mineral dust has been coded for 189 of these cases. There is good correlation between the severity of asbestosis and the coded exposures, electron microscopic mineral fibre count, and the fibre count as seen under the light microscope. The information collected showed that mesotheliomas occurred in those who had had minimal or slight asbestosis, by contrast with the pulmonary carcinomas found in those with moderate to severe asbestosis. The amphibole (crocidolite and amosite) lung content correlated with severity of asbestosis.},

  Abstract                 = {This report presents data gathered from a series of asbestos disease screening examinations of 9,605 United States sheet metal workers who were first employed in the trade at least 20 years before the examination. The overall prevalence of asbestos-related radiographic changes was 31.1\%: 18.8\% had pleural abnormalities alone, 6.6\% had parenchymal abnormalities (International Labour Office (ILO) score of 1/0 or higher) alone, and 5.7\% had both. Among those with 40 years or more since entering the trade, 41.5\% had radiographic signs of asbestos-related disease, 24.2\% pleural alone, 7.7\% parenchymal alone, and 9.6\% both pleural and parenchymal abnormalities. After controlling for several surrogates for asbestos exposure level, cigarette smoking was found to increase risk of parenchymal, and more modestly, pleural abnormalities. Each pack-year was associated with a 1\% increased prevalence odds ratios for parenchymal abnormalities (ILO category 1 compared to category 0), and 0.4\% increased prevalence odds ratios for pleural abnormalities. A history of shipyard employment also produced significantly increased prevalence odds ratios for each radiographic category. More that 90\% of chest radiographs were classified by A or B readers; after adjustment for other risk factors, A readers were more likely to report parenchymal abnormalities of category 1, but not more likely to report category 2 or pleural abnormalities, than B readers.},
