Good question!  It's a rounding issue. I decided to go back and recalculate the PAF so I would have the exact # with decimals (I rounded what's in the table in Word document to a whole number). Then I used that to calculate the n. I didn't know Denis could only use an integer for the calculation, so it probably wasn't necessary to go that route, but oh well!

Again, formula is pc(rr - 1)/rr. Since pc is cases exposed/total cases and we take PAF and multiply by total cases to get attributable cases, it ends up being (cases exposed)(rr - 1)/rr. Does that make sense?

where calculated numerator is 0 (when OR < 1) we use a Freeman-Tukey Double Arcsine Transformation
