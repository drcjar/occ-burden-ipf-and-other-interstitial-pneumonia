  Abstract                 = {This review assesses the contribution of occupational asbestos exposure to the occurrence of mesothelioma and lung cancer in Europe. Available information on national asbestos consumption, proportions of the population exposed, and exposure levels is summarized. Population-based studies from various European regions on occupational asbestos exposure, mesothelioma, and lung cancer are reviewed. Asbestos consumption in 1994 ranged, per capita, between 0. 004 kg in northern Europe and 2.4 kg in the former Soviet Union. Population surveys from northern Europe indicate that 15 to 30\% of the male (and a few percent of the female) population has ever had occupational exposure to asbestos, mainly in construction (75\% in Finland) or in shipyards. Studies on mesothelioma combining occupational history with biologic exposure indices indicate occupational asbestos exposure in 62 to 85\% of the cases. Population attributable risks for lung cancer among males range between 2 and 50\% for definite asbestos exposure. After exclusion of the most extreme values because of methodologic aspects, most of the remaining estimates are within the range of 10 to 20\%. Estimates of women are lower. Extrapolation of the results to national figures would decrease the estimates. Norwegian estimates indicate that one-third of expected asbestos-related lung cancers might be avoided if former asbestos workers quit smoking. The combination of a current high asbestos consumption per capita, high exposure levels, and high underlying lung cancer rates in Central Europe and the former Soviet Union suggests that the lung cancers will arise from the smoking-asbestos interaction should be a major concern.},

  Abstract                 = {The present article reports on two conceptual and methodological issues concerning interstitial lung disease (ILD) about which there is a lot of misunderstanding and contradiction: the investigation of epidemics and clusters and the classification and epidemiology of ILD. In general, an epidemic is the occurrence of cases of an illness in excess of normal expectancy. The investigation of an epidemic often demands a number of sequential studies: first descriptive, then aetiological. Clusters consist of an increase in incidence of much smaller magnitude, perhaps excluding the possibility that this is merely a result of chance. In recent years, more valid statistical methods for the assessment of clusters have developed. For interstitial lung disease in particular, different classifications exist that are sometimes inconsistent and may change with time. All diseases require a process of ascertainment, whereby they are identified, classified and perhaps registered. The two most employed epidemiological techniques for testing aetiological hypotheses are the cohort and case-referent approaches.},

  Abstract                 = {Increased prevalence of chronic interstitial pneumonia (CIP) is reported in dust-exposed subjects. We investigated the prevalence of CIP in silicosis and mixed-dust pneumoconiosis and sought morphologic differences of CIP between the pneumoconiosis and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).We reviewed CT scans of 243 silicosis and mixed-dust pneumoconiosis patients to identify any cases of parenchymal lung lesions showing a CIP pattern, and compared the CT findings with those of 62 patients with IPF. Two observers independently scored CT images and classified the CT pattern as typical or not typical for IPF. Differences were sought between the groups using a nonparametric test, Fisher exact test, and a logistic regression analysis. A radiopathologic correlation was performed in 11 pneumoconiosis patients.Twenty-eight patients (11.5\%) showed CIP on CT. Seven patients (25\%) showed a pattern not typical of IPF, while the remaining patients showed a pattern typical of IPF, 11 of which were confirmed pathologically. The extent of fibrosis did not differ between the groups; however, patients with pneumoconiosis showed less traction bronchiectasis (odds ratio [OR], 0.19; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.08 to 0.48; p < 0.001), more subpleural homogeneous attenuation (OR, 2.56; 95\% CI, 1.55 to 4.23; p < 0.001), and fibrosis was more randomly distributed (OR, 315.38; 95\% CI, 4.68 to 21244.63; p = 0.007). Pathologically, subpleural homogeneous attenuation corresponded to dense fibrosis often with abundant silicotic nodules.Prevalence of CIP in pneumoconiosis was approximately 12\% on CT. One fourth of patients showed an atypical IPF pattern, and the others showed a typical IPF pattern.},

  Abstract                 = {Random error (misclassification) in exposure measurements usually biases a relative risk, regression coefficient, or other effect measure towards the null value (no association). The most important exception is Berkson type error, which causes little or no bias. Berkson type error arises, in particular, due to use of group average exposure in place of individual values. Random error in exposure measurements, Berkson or otherwise, reduces the power of a study, making it more likely that real associations are not detected. Random error in confounding variables compromises the control of their effect, leaving residual confounding. Random error in a variable that modifies the effect of exposure on health--for example, an indicator of susceptibility--tends to diminish the observed modification of effect, but error in the exposure can create a supurious appearance of modification. Methods are available to correct for bias (but not generally power loss) due to measurement error, if information on the magnitude and type of error is available. These methods can be complicated to use, however, and should be used cautiously as "correction" can magnify confounding if it is present.},

  Abstract                 = {Thirty-five necropsied cases of diffuse malignant mesothelioma of pleura and six cases of mesothelioma of peritoneum are reported. Occupational histories from 40 cases showed that 32 cases (80\%) were definitely exposed to asbestos; six cases (15\%) were probably exposed and two (5\%) had no known exposure. The mean latent interval was 34 years. Occupational histories of 56 control patients matched in pairs for age and sex with 28 of the mesothelioma cases revealed definite exposure to asbestos in 12 controls (21\%), probable exposure in 11 (20\%), and no evidence of exposure in 33 (59\%). The difference in incidence of exposure between mesotheliomas and controls is statistically highly significant. Six-micron histological sections of lung, available in 39 mesothelioma cases, contained coated asbestos fibres in 36 cases (92\%). Sixteen cases of mesothelioma showing fibres were free of asbestosis; asbestosis was slight in 14 cases, moderately severe in five cases, and severe in one case. The incidence of asbestos bodies in sections from mesothelioma cases was significantly higher than in a previously reported series of routine necropsies examined by lung smear. Counts of coated and uncoated asbestos fibres were performed on samples of lung tissue from 33 mesothelioma cases. No fibres were identified in one case and only occasional coated fibres in a second case. The remainder gave counts ranging from 154 thousand to 684 million fibres per gram dry weight. Uncoated fibres were invariably present and usually comprised 50 to 80\% of the count. No relationship was found between total fibre count and the latent period of the mesothelioma. Fibre counts were also performed on lung samples from 18 smear-positive and 30 smear-negative routine necropsies. Cases with numerous coated fibres in the smear gave total fibre counts similar to those of mesothelioma cases without asbestosis. Routine cases with only one fibre in the smear usually yielded only occasional fibres on analysis. Coated and uncoated fibres were found in 13 out of 30 smear-negative cases, indicating a true incidence of 56\% of exposure to asbestos in the whole necropsy series. When compared with the mesothelioma series the difference in incidence of fibres remains statistically significant. The data suggest that, on Tyneside, exposure to asbestos sufficient to cause an appreciable risk of developing mesothelioma has usually occurred through occupational exposure rather than by general environmental pollution by asbestos.},

  Abstract                 = {Despite the advances in medical therapy and technology, the prognosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) remains poor and the need for disease prevention based on identifying the risk factors becomes mandatory. Occupational and environmental exposures were studied in several countries and found to play important role in the disease development. However, in Egypt, a little attention has been paid to study the effect of these factors in the disease development.To identify the occupational and environmental risk factors associated with the development of IPF in Egypt.A multicenter hospital-based case-control study was carried out in chest hospitals affiliated to three Egyptian cities-Cairo, Tanta and Mansoura. Subjects were 201 patients with confirmed IPF (cases) and 205 age-, sex- and residence-matched controls. Data on occupational and environmental factors were obtained from a questionnaire. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to determine the independent risk factors of IPF in both sexes for single factors with adjustment for age, residence and smoking status.Compared with the controls, the risk of IPF in male workers was observed to increase significantly in chemical and petrochemical industries and carpentry and wood working (OR = 2.56, 95\% CI: 1.02-7.01), and with occupational exposures to wood dust and wood preservatives. Among female workers, a significant increase was observed in farming (OR = 3.34, 95\% CI: 1.17-10.12), raising birds and occupational exposures to animal feeds, products and dusts and pesticides. Risk of IPF decreased significantly in male workers and insignificantly among female workers in sales and clerical related activities. The environmental exposures to birds and cats were significantly associated with elevated risk of IPF development in both sexes.In Egypt, farming, raising birds and wood working are important risk factors for the development of IPF.},

The questionnaire asked for information on smoking habits, occupational airborne exposure and respiratory disorders.A random sample of 4992 subjects from the general population aged 15-70 years of Hordaland County, Norway.The overall response rate was 90\%, with a 63\% response to the initial letter. The response rates to the first and second reminder letters were 56\% and 36\% respectively. In 20\% of the non-respondents an uncompleted questionnaire was returned with cause for non-response; in two thirds of these the cause for non-response was that the subject was not resident at the mailing address. A home visit to a random sample of 50 urban non-respondents provided further information on 29 subjects. A wrong address at the Central Population Registry and the subject's feeling of lack of personal benefit from a postal survey were the major reasons for non-response. Smokers were late respondents and subjects with respiratory disorders tended to be early respondents.The main reasons for non-response were a wrong mailing address and a feeling of lack of personal benefit from responding. Using only the initial letter would have changed the estimated prevalence of smokers from 39\% to 35\%. Otherwise, the estimated prevalence of the exposure and disease variables as well as the associations between them were only slightly changed after including the respondents to the first and second reminder letters.},

Results are based on 248 cases, aged 20-75 years, diagnosed at 16 referral centers between January 1989 and July 1993. There were 491 controls ascertained by random digit dialing and matched to cases on sex, age, and geographic region. Data were collected using a standard telephone questionnaire. Occupational factors were based on a detailed history of jobs lasting 6 months or more and job activity, hobby, and specific substance checklists. Several occupational factors, adjusted for age and smoking in conditional multivariate logistic regression analyses, were significantly associated with IPF: farming (odds ratio (OR) = 1.6, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.0, 2.5); livestock (OR = 2.7, 95\% CI: 1.3, 5.5); hairdressing (OR = 4.4, 95\% CI: 1.2, 16.3); metal dust (OR = 2.0, 95\% CI: 1.0, 4.0); raising birds (OR = 4.7, 95\% CI: 1.6, 14.1); stone cutting/polishing (OR = 3.9, 95\% CI: 1.2, 12.7); and vegetable dust/animal dust (OR = 4.7, 95\% CI: 2.1, 10.4). Interaction was detected between smoking and exposure to livestock (p = 0.06) and farming (p = 0.08). Results confirm previous studies showing increased risk associated with dusty environments.},

The study included 248 cases, and 491 control subjects identified through random-digit dialing, matched to cases in sex, age, and geographic region. Telephone interviews were conducted with both cases and controls to collect information on potential risk factors for IPF, including smoking and household, occupational, and environmental exposures. Pulmonary function tests, X-rays, computed tomographic (CT) scans of the chest, and lung biopsy reports were submitted by referring centers to support the diagnoses. An a priori hypothesis that smoking is associated with IPF was examined with conditional logistic regression analyses. More cases (72\%) than control subjects (63\%) had a history of ever smoking. The odds ratio (OR) for ever smoking was 1.6 (95\% CI: 1.1 to 2.4). Risk was significantly elevated for former smokers (OR = 1.9; 95\% CI: 1.3 to 2.9) and for smokers with 21 to 40 pack-yr (OR = 2.3; 95\% CI: 1.3 to 3.8). A history of smoking is associated with an increased risk for the development of IPF. Although there was no clear exposure-response pattern with cumulative consumption of cigarettes, there was a trend for time since cessation of smoking, with the highest risk for those who had most recently quit.},

  Abstract                 = {idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a generally fatal disorder with a reported median survival of 3 to 6 yr. This has been based on relatively few studies with diagnoses inconsistently confirmed by ade- quate lung biopsy. Retrospective analysis of 104 patients with IPF who had open lung biopsy (OLB) at Mayo Medical Center from 1976 to 1985 was performed to establish the overall survival rate, the spectrum of histopathological subgroups and their associated prognostic significance. The study group consisted of 54 men and 50 women with a median age of 63 yr. Median survival was 3.8 yr af- ter diagnosis by OLB with an estimated 10 yr survival of 27%. Current histopathologic review showed a heterogeneous group including usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), desquamative interstitial pneu- monia (DIP), nonspecific interstitial pneumonia/fibrosis (NSIP), acute interstitial pneumonia (AIP), bronchiolitis, bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), and others. Median survival of the UIP group was 2.8 yr which is significantly worse (p ? 0.001) than for other subgroups of chronic interstitial pneumonias. IPF includes several histopathologic subgroups with significantly different survival rates. Patients with UIP have worse survival than patients with other types of idiopathic chronic interstitial pneumonias including NSIP. Accurate histopathologic classification is essential for prognostication in patients with IPF. Bjoraker JA, Ryu JH, Edwin MK, Myers JL, Tazelaar HD, Schroeder DR, Offord KP.

IPF/UIP and NSIP closely mimic each other clinically but NSIP has a far better outcome. However, it remains unclear if NSIP is a truly separate and distinct entity. The histopathological pattern of NSIP can be found in a wide variety of clinical and radiological contexts. This review addresses these and other uncertainties regarding NSIP and UIP.},

For each job, exposure assessments for asbestos and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were obtained by expertise (TBQ expertise) and by algorithm using the TBQ (TBQ algorithm) as well as by expert appraisals based on all available occupational data (REFERENCE expertise) considered to be the gold standard. Additionally, a Job Exposure Matrix (JEM)-based evaluation for asbestos was also obtained. On the 497 jobs, the various evaluations were contrasted using Cohen's κ coefficient of agreement. Additionally, on the total case-control population, the asbestos dose-response relationship based on the TBQ algorithm was compared with the JEM-based assessment.Regarding asbestos, the TBQ-exposure estimates agreed well with the REFERENCE estimate (TBQ expertise: level-weighted κ (lwk)=0.68; TBQ algorithm: lwk=0.61) but less so with the JEM estimate (TBQ expertise: lwk=0.31; TBQ algorithm: lwk=0.26). Regarding PAHs, the agreements between REFERENCE expertise and TBQ were less good (TBQ expertise: lwk=0.43; TBQ algorithm: lwk=0.36). In the case-control study analysis, the dose-response relationship between lung cancer and cumulative asbestos based on the JEM is less steep than with the TBQ-algorithm exposure assessment and statistically non-significant.Asbestos-exposure estimates based on the TBQ were consistent with the REFERENCE expertise and yielded a steeper dose-response relationship than the JEM. For PAHs, results were less clear.},

Detection from cancer registry data increased to 75\% under ICD-10 in Scotland, confirming earlier predictions of the benefit of ICD-10's more specific mesothelioma codes. Including the accidental poisoning codes E866.4 (ICD-9) and X49 (ICD-10), covering poisoning by 'unspecified' and 'other' causes, which appear to have been used as coding surrogates for mesothelioma when asbestos exposure was explicitly mentioned in deaths suggestive of a mesothelioma, and which are recorded as the underlying cause of death in 4-7\% of mesotheliomas, may improve the mesothelioma detection rate in future epidemiological studies.},

  Abstract                 = {Total pulmonary nonasbestos mineral content was determined for a series of 20 patients who had no occupational dust exposure. To extract mineral fibers, lung tissue was dissolved in bleach and the treated sediment transferred to the electron microscope grid. Mineral fibers were identified using electron diffraction and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy. The mean number of nonasbestos fibers, 106 X 10(3)/g wet lung, was almost identical to the mean number of asbestos fibers, 102 X 10(3)/g. Thirteen different species or groups of nonasbestos minerals were found: apatite accounted for 18\% of the total and talc for 16\%. All other forms accounted for less than 8\% each. Silica was found in every lung, and talc in 19 of 20 lungs. Of the fibers, 86\% were shorter than 5 microns, and most of the fibers had aspect ratios less than 15. No correlations were seen between numbers or types of fibers and age, sex, or smoking. It is concluded that (1) substantial numbers of nonasbestos fibers are present in lungs of the general population. Most of these fibers are short and of low aspect ratio; and (2) by phase microscopy one is as likely to observe nonasbestos as asbestos fibers in these preparations, indicating that light microscopic methods are not suitable for this type of analysis. These data provide a baseline for comparison with patients believed to have a mineral fiber-related disease.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Objective-To assess whether the increased risk of disease related to asbestos in occupations from the con- struction and engineering industries applies equally to pleural cancer, peri- toneal cancer, and asbestosis. Methods-Analysis was based on deaths among men aged 20-74 in England and Wales during 1979-80 and 1982-90. (n = 1 656 096). Information about cause of death and the last full time occupation of decedents was derived from death certifi- cates. Proportional mortality ratios (PMRs) by occupation were calculated for each of pleural cancer, peritoneal cancer, and asbestosis. Results-Altogether, 2848 deaths were attributed to cancer of the pleura, 362 to cancer of the peritoneum, and 281 to asbestosis. When occupations were ranked according to PMRs from these diseases, striking differences were found. The category of construction workers which included laggers had the highest mortality from peritoneal cancer (PMR 990, 64 deaths), but a PMR of only 160 (77 deaths) for pleural cancer. In contrast, several occupations with much higher mortality from pleural tumours had no excess of peritoneal cancer. PMRs for asbestosis related more closely to those for peritoneal than pleural cancer. Conclusions-These findings suggest that the exposure-response relations for dis- eases related to asbestos are not all linear, and that risks of pleural mesothelioma may be underestimated by simple extrap- olation from observations in cohorts with heavy exposure.},

It is frequently converted to a percent by multiplying the ratio by 100. (PMRs) for cancer of the pleura (ICD-9 = 163), cancer of the peri- toneum (ICD-9 = 158-8 and 158-9), and asbestosis (ICD-9 = 501), PMRs for asbestosis related more closely to those for peritoneal than pleural cancer exposure-response relations for mesothelioma and asbestosis are non-linear, with the risk of pleural mesothelioma increasing relatively more steeply at low exposures but less steeply at high exposures* the risks of pleural mesothelioma may be underestimated if a linear exposure-response is assumed. This should be taken into account when control limits are reviewed.},

The relationships derived from the initial comparison were tested in a separate group of biopsy-proved UIP (n = 30) and NSIP (n = 23) cases. Two observers independently scored thin-section CT images for extent, distribution, and coarseness of fibrosis; proportion of ground-glass opacification; severity of traction bronchiectasis; and extent of emphysema.After controlling for extent of fibrosis, patients with asbestosis had coarser fibrosis than those with IPF (odds ratio, 1.52; 95\% CI: 1.25, 1.84; P <.001). Compared with the biopsy-proved cases, the asbestosis cases involved coarser fibrosis (after controlling for disease extent) than the NSIP cases (odds ratio, 2.48; 95\% CI: 1.49, 4.11; P <.001) but fibrosis similar to that in the UIP cases. A basal and subpleural distribution of disease was usual in all subgroups but significantly more prevalent (P, <.01 to.001) with asbestosis than with UIP or NSIP.The thin-section CT pattern of asbestosis closely resembles that of biopsy-proved UIP and differs markedly from that of biopsy-proved NSIP.},

  Abstract                 = {The present study reviews recent data concerning the assessment of exhaled breath condensate (EBC) pulmonary biomarkers in the field of occupational medicine.EBC is a suitable matrix to assess respiratory health status in workers exposed to pneumotoxic substances, due to its ability to quantify lung tissue dose and consequent pulmonary effects. Published data show that toxic metals and trace elements are detectable in EBC, raising the possibility of using this medium to quantify the lung tissue dose of metals occurring in occupational settings. EBC analysis of biomarkers of exposure highlighted the potential use of EBC as completion of the biological monitoring of pneumotoxic compounds. Different biomarkers of effect, such as oxidative stress and inflammatory-derived biomarkers have been applied in the investigation of occupational asthma and pneumoconiosis, suggesting that the collection of EBC may contribute to studying the pathological state of the airways of workers with acute and chronic exposure to pollutants. EBC measurements also seem to be reliable to detect the presence of carcinogenic processes in the respiratory system, by the analysis of various markers of oxidative stress, angiogenesis and DNA alterations related to lung cancer. This approach may open new frontiers in the study of workers currently or previously exposed to pulmonary carcinogenic agents.The analysis of EBC is one of the most promising methods currently available for the study of pulmonary biomarkers of exposure, effect and susceptibility in occupational settings; being collected in a totally noninvasive way, it is particularly suitable to be applied in field studies and for longitudinal assessments of pulmonary biology.},

  Abstract                 = {The etiology of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) remains poorly understood, but some studies have suggested that cigarette smoking or other occupational or environmental exposures, diabetes mellitus, or gastroesophageal reflux may play a role. In this study we evaluated the clinical records of a group of 97 consecutive patients with IPF, and 560 patients suffering 5 different respiratory disorders that were examined as controls: asthma (n=111), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (n=132), squamous cell lung carcinoma (n=118), lung adenocarcinoma (n=101) and patients with otorhinolaryngology problems but without lung disease (n=98). In bivariate analyses male sex, diabetes mellitus and being former cigarette smoker were associated with IPF. After adjusting by these variables, multivariate analysis revealed that type 2 diabetes mellitus [11.3\% in IPF patients vs 2.9\% in controls, OR=4.3 (95\% CI: 1.9-9.8), p<0.0001] was an independent risk factor associated to IPF. Our results provide additional evidence of a putative relationship between DM2 and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Experimental research is necessary for thorough assessment of the pathogenic mechanisms involved in this association.},

We confirmed association with TERT at 5p15, MUC5B at 11p15 and the 3q26 region near TERC, and we identified seven newly associated loci (Pmeta = 2.4 × 10(-8) to 1.1 × 10(-19)), including FAM13A (4q22), DSP (6p24), OBFC1 (10q24), ATP11A (13q34), DPP9 (19p13) and chromosomal regions 7q22 and 15q14-15. Our results suggest that genes involved in host defense, cell-cell adhesion and DNA repair contribute to risk of fibrotic IIPs.},

  Abstract                 = {Pet dogs with spontaneous mesothelioma were used to identify environmental exposures that might increase their owner's risk of asbestos-related disease. These animals share man's domicile environment, yet do not indulge in activities (e.g., smoking, working) which confound interpretation of epidemiologic studies. Eighteen histologically confirmed canine mesotheliomas were diagnosed at the Veterinary Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, from April 1977 to December 1981. Sixteen owners of cases and 32 owners of age, breed, and sex-matched controls were interviewed to determine their occupation and medical history and their dog's medical history, life style, diet, and exposure to asbestos. An asbestos-related occupation or hobby of a household member and use of flea repellents on the dog were significantly associated with mesothelioma. In addition, there was a trend indicating an increased risk of mesothelioma with an urban residence. Lung tissue from three dogs with mesothelioma and one dog with squamous cell carcinoma of the lung had higher levels of chrysotile asbestos fibers than lung tissue from control dogs. These findings indicate that well-designed epidemiological studies of spontaneous tumors in pet animals may provide insight into the role of environmental factors in human cancers and serve as a valuable sentinel model to identify environmental health hazards for humans.},

Postmortem samples of his lung were digested, and the inorganic material present was extracted and examined using transmission electron microscopy, electron diffraction, and electron microprobe analysis. Uncoated asbestos fibers were present (1.4 X 10(5)/g wet lung), but the surprising finding was the presence of a large number of fly ash particles (6 X 10(6)/g wet lung). Fly ash, the particulate material produced during coal combustion, has not previously been reported to be present in human lung tissue. Although the contribution of the asbestos to this man's lung disease is uncertain, we believe, based on previous studies implicating aluminum silicates in pneumoconiosis, that the fly ash, an aluminum silicate, may be a contributing factor.},

  Abstract                 = {In the course of setting up the National Mesothelioma Surveillance Program (PNSM), established in France in 1998, the question arose as to the most suitable method of assessing occupational exposure. The aim of this study was to define the most suitable rating method for assessing occupational asbestos exposure in order to assess medico-social care.The study included 100 subjects-50 cases of mesothelioma and 50 controls-randomly selected and representing 457 jobs held. Job asbestos exposure was assessed by a six-expert panel using two methods: "by job" rating, where all the jobs in were assessed regardless of the subjects; and "by subject" rating, where all the jobs of a subject were assessed at the same time. Consensus was obtained and subjects' exposure was calculated for each rating. Then, two internal experts assessed job asbestos exposure with the "by subject" rating. Kappa coefficients were used to measure agreement between the ratings.Agreement between "by job" and "by subject" ratings was very good for subject probability of exposure (kappa = 0.84) and cumulative exposure index (kappa = 0.80). Agreement between the six-expert panel and the two internal experts was good for subject exposure (kappa for probability = 0.71; kappa for cumulative exposure index= 0.68).This study shows that the two rating systems have good or very good agreement. These results validate the routine use in the PNSM of the "by subject" rating, with the advantage of being convenient and quick to provide feedback on occupational asbestos exposure to mesothelioma cases for compensation.},

  Abstract                 = {Use of control (comparison) groups is a powerful research tool. In case-control studies, controls estimate the frequency of an exposure in the population under study. Controls can be taken from known or unknown study populations. A known group consists of a defined population observed over a period, such as passengers on a cruise ship. When the study group is known, a sample of the population can be used as controls. If no population roster exists, then techniques such as random-digit dialling can be used. Sometimes, however, the study group is unknown, for example, motor-vehicle crash victims brought to an emergency department, who may come from far away. In this situation, hospital controls, neighbourhood controls, and friend, associate, or relative controls can be used. In general, one well-selected control group is better than two or more. When the number of cases is small, the ratio of controls to cases can be raised to improve the ability to find important differences. Although no ideal control group exists, readers need to think carefully about how representative the controls are. Poor choice of controls can lead to both wrong results and possible medical harm.},

  Abstract                 = {The etiology of cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis (CFA) remains largely obscure, although a 1996 report suggested an increased risk from occupational exposure to metal and wood dusts. Using data from death certificates in England and Wales, we sought evidence of any relationship between occupation and CFA and of the extent of any temporospatial clustering of place of birth and place of death as possible evidence of a geographically related environmental factor.Data on occupation and address (postal code) were obtained from certificates of men and women dying as a result of CFA between 1981 and 1990 and were compared with national mortality statistics. Place of birth data were extracted from certificates for deaths between 1993 and 1995, the only available years, and were compared with national birth statistics.Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were raised (p<0.05) in the following four occupational groups: members of the armed forces (SMR, 217.8); miners and quarrymen (SMR, 142.0); service, sports, and recreation workers (SMR, 118.6); and electrical and electronic workers (SMR, 146.6). Of these four groups, the latter group might be worth testing in a future study. There was statistical evidence of geographic clustering in postal code sectors for the recorded place of death, but the high-rate areas were different in men and women. Deaths were increased for those subjects born in urban areas, although these did not follow a clear geographic pattern.Overall, these analyses provide little evidence of any important contribution from environmental factors to the etiology of CFA and suggest that more consideration be given to alternative concepts of causation.},

  Abstract                 = {A common promoter polymorphism (rs35705950) in MUC5B, the gene encoding mucin 5B, is associated with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. It is not known whether this polymorphism is associated with interstitial lung disease in the general population.We performed a blinded assessment of interstitial lung abnormalities detected in 2633 participants in the Framingham Heart Study by means of volumetric chest computed tomography (CT). We evaluated the relationship between the abnormalities and the genotype at the rs35705950 locus.Of the 2633 chest CT scans that were evaluated, interstitial lung abnormalities were present in 177 (7\%). Participants with such abnormalities were more likely to have shortness of breath and chronic cough and reduced measures of total lung and diffusion capacity, as compared with participants without such abnormalities. After adjustment for covariates, for each copy of the minor rs35705950 allele, the odds of interstitial lung abnormalities were 2.8 times greater (95\% confidence interval [CI], 2.0 to 3.9; P<0.001), and the odds of definite CT evidence of pulmonary fibrosis were 6.3 times greater (95\% CI, 3.1 to 12.7; P<0.001). Although the evidence of an association between the MUC5B genotype and interstitial lung abnormalities was greater among participants who were older than 50 years of age, a history of cigarette smoking did not appear to influence the association.The MUC5B promoter polymorphism was found to be associated with interstitial lung disease in the general population. Although this association was more apparent in older persons, it did not appear to be influenced by cigarette smoking.

Of the 95 patients with persistent sputum, 19 (20.0%) were nonsmokers. Of the 174 men registered as having asbestosis, 56 had died, whereas the expected number of deaths among men of the same age in the Finnish general population was only 23.4. The respective figures for lung cancer were 19 observed and 2.1 expected. No excess mortality was found for other malignomas. Among men with asbestosis, the life expectancy was shorter for smokers than for non- and exsmokers.},

Age and sex distribution of the subjects revealed a high peak in their seventh decade with males predominating. The IPF rate was more than two times higher (p < 0.01) among subjects engaged in occupations that exposed them to dust or organic solvents compared with those in other jobs. To ascertain job characteristics, an autopsy-case control study was conducted using other annual volumes of the autopsy data records and a similar tendency was observed. Then, a live-case control study was undertaken of 86 subjects with IPF. A significantly higher odds ratio was noted among metal production workers and miners compared with healthy and hospital control subjects (1.37 and 1.34, respectively, p < 0.01), and also a significantly lower odds ratio among subjects who frequently eat fish. Taken together with results of recent in vitro studies, the intrapulmonary deposition of hazardous dusts, especially metallic dusts, appears to play at least a partial role in initiating IPF.},

Bronchoalveolar lavage macrophages from 22 patients have been examined. Twelve patients had occupational exposure to asbestos, talc, silica, hard metal or printing ink, while 10 had no known history of dust exposure. X-ray microprobe analysis identified particles which related to the known exposures, superimposed on a background of other particles related to smoking (kaolinite and mica) or to the general environment (silicon, titanium, and iron). The particle identification provided useful objective confirmation of the known exposures, except for silica, which could not be distinguished from the general background levels. X-ray microanalysis using BAL macrophages can be helpful for clarification of mixed dust exposures, to identify particles when light microscopy indicates retained dust in patients with no known history of exposure, and to monitor retained particles after removal from exposure.},

In 1984 the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys changed the rules on coding according to rule 3 of the World Health Organisation, so that if the cause of death was recorded as, for example, unspecified pneumonia or broncho- pneumonia in part 1 of the death certificate the disease mentioned in part 2 became the underlying cause of death. Duplicate coding of all deaths ascribed to cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis in 1984 according to the new and old rules showed a 6% increase in deaths ascribed to the disease under the new rule. Consequently the number of deaths from 1984 onwards should be scaled down by a factor of 0-94 so that the two periods are comparable. explores why mort rate increasing. more diagnosis? cf rcp map :-)x`},

  Abstract                 = {The last century experienced remarkable advances in the classification, diagnosis, and understanding of the pathogenesis of the interstitial lung diseases. Technological advances, particularly physiologic testing, lung imaging studies, bronchoalveolar lavage, surgical lung biopsy, and histopathologic assessment, improved our understanding of these entities. In particular, the advent of high-resolution computed tomography, the narrowed pathologic definition of usual interstitial pneumonia, and recognition of the prognostic importance of separating usual interstitial pneumonia from other idiopathic interstitial pneumonia patterns have profoundly changed the approach to these processes. Most recently, genetic medicine, the use of new technologies (e.g., microarrays, mass spectroscopic analysis of proteins, and laser capture microdissection), and the development of animal models have had a major impact on understanding the pathogenesis and potential molecular targets for interfering with fibrogenesis. This article highlights some of the advances and changes in clinical practice that took place in the management of patients with interstitial lung diseases over the last century.},

  Abstract                 = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a devastating, age-related lung disease of unknown cause that has few treatment options. This disease was once thought to be a chronic inflammatory process, but current evidence indicates that the fibrotic response is driven by abnormally activated alveolar epithelial cells (AECs). These cells produce mediators that induce the formation of fibroblast and myofibroblast foci through the proliferation of resident mesenchymal cells, attraction of circulating fibrocytes, and stimulation of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition. The fibroblast and myofibroblast foci secrete excessive amounts of extracellular matrix, mainly collagens, resulting in scarring and destruction of the lung architecture. The mechanisms that link idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis with ageing and aberrant epithelial activation are unknown; evidence suggests that the abnormal recapitulation of developmental pathways and epigenetic changes have a role. In this Seminar, we review recent data on the clinical course, therapeutic options, and underlying mechanisms thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.},

  Abstract                 = {The molecular pathomechanisms underlying idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) are elusive, but chronic epithelial injury has recently been suggested as key event.We investigated the possible implication of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-mediated apoptosis in sporadic IPF.We analyzed peripheral explanted lung tissues from patients with sporadic IPF (n = 24), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (n = 9), and organ donors (n = 12) for expression of major ER stress mediators and apoptosis markers by means of immunoblotting, semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry, and the TUNEL method.Compared with COPD and donor lungs, protein levels of ER stress mediators, such as processed p50 activating transcription factor (ATF)-6 and ATF-4 and the apoptosis-inductor CHOP (C/EBP-homologous protein), as well as transcript levels of spliced X-box binding protein (XBP)-1, were significantly elevated in lung homogenates and type II alveolar epithelial cells (AECIIs) of IPF lungs. Proapoptotic, oligomeric forms of Bax, which play a key role in ER stress-mediated apoptosis downstream of CHOP induction, as well as caspase-3 cleavage, could be detected in IPF lungs. By means of immunohistochemistry, exclusive induction of active ATF-6, ATF-4, and CHOP in AECIIs was encountered in IPF but not in COPD or donor lungs. Immunoreactivity was most prominent in the epithelium near dense zones of fibrosis and fibroblast foci, where these ER stress markers colocalized with markers of apoptosis (TUNEL, cleaved caspase-3).Severe ER stress response in the AECIIs of patients with sporadic IPF may underlie the apoptosis of this cell type and development of fibrosis in this disease.},

  Abstract                 = {In epidemiological questionnaire studies results can be influenced by non-responder bias. However, in respiratory epidemiology this has been analysed in very few recently published papers. The aim of our paper is to assess if the results found in our previous postal questionnaire study in an adult population in Northern Finland were biased by non-response.A random sample of 385 persons from the 1,284 non-responders in a previous postal questionnaire study was examined. The same questionnaire as in the original study was again mailed to these persons, and those still not answering were contacted by phone.Totally 183 complete answers (48\%) were collected. Lack of interest (56\%) and forgetting to mail the response letter (22\%) were the most common reasons to non-response. Typical non-responders were young men and current smokers who less frequently reported respiratory symptoms in exercise and asthma than the responders in the original study. Answers collected by phone gave for some questions higher prevalence rates than postal answers.Firstly, in this population the response rate (83.6\%) in the original study was high enough to provide reliable results for respiratory symptoms and diseases, only the prevalence of current smoking was biased by non-response. Secondly, the methods used for collecting responses in a non-response study may influence the results.},

Multiple sequential chest radiographs obtained between 1955 and 2004 in 84 workers exposed to amphiboles associated with vermiculite in the town of Libby, Montana, were studied. A panel of three NIOSH B readers reviewed each worker's longitudinal chest radiograph series in reverse chronologic order and achieved a consensus reading for each radiograph. Measures of exposure were compared between workers with and those without progression of parenchymal and pleural abnormalities.Because of the way the study was designed, all subjects had pleural (n = 84) and/or parenchymal (n = 26) abnormalities on the most recent chest radiograph. Compared with other investigations that used different methods, this investigation revealed shorter latency periods (defined as the interval between date of hire and date of earliest radiographic detection) for circumscribed pleural plaque (median latency, 8.6 years) and pleural calcification (median latency, 17.5 years). Pleural abnormalities progressed in 64 workers, while parenchymal abnormalities progressed in 14. No significant differences were found with regard to measures of exposure between workers with and those without progression.The latency period for the development of pleural plaques may be shorter than previously reported. Early plaques are subtle and may not be detectable except at retrospective review.},

  Abstract                 = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fibrotic lung disease of unknown cause characterized by relentlessly progressive restrictive-ventilatory limitation, hypoxia, dyspnea, and cough. Both the incidence and prevalence of IPF appears to be increasing, with little impact on its dismal 3-year median survival, despite two decades of clinical trials. Increasingly recognized are the serious associated comorbid illnesses, including pulmonary hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease, obstructive sleep apnea, obesity, lung cancer, and depression that further contribute to the substantial rise in the use of IPF-related healthcare resources. At present, lung transplantation remains the sole viable treatment for the few who qualify. Pharmacologic interventions targeting lung function and survival have remained largely disappointing, and very few investigations have specifically targeted comorbid conditions, symptoms, quality-of-life, and healthcare resource utilization. In reviewing the burden of illness associated with IPF, including the epidemiology, comorbidities, quality-of-life and the physical, psychosocial, and economic costs of this devastating disease, we hope to highlight some of the unmet medical needs associated with IPF, and encourage both public support and further investigations into these and other patient-centered outcomes and not just that of survival and lung function.},

However, 23\% of patients required hospitalization for a respiratory disorder and 21\% died. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis was the primary cause of death in 89\% of patients who died, and an apparent acute clinical deterioration preceded death in 47\% of these patients.The instrument used to define the pace of deterioration and cause of death was applied retrospectively.Recognition of the common occurrence of acute fatal deterioration in patients with mild to moderate IPF has important implications for monitoring patients and supports early referral for lung transplantation.},

Temporal trends in SMRs were also examined. Proportional mortality ratios (PMRs) were calculated using the Southampton (based on the 1980 standard occupational classification) coding scheme. Temporal trends in PMRs were also examined.The annual number of mesothelioma deaths has increased from 153 in 1968 to 1848 in 2001. Current deaths in males account for about 85\% of the cases. The areas of West Dunbartonshire (SMR 637), Barrow-in-Furness (593), Plymouth (396) and Portsmouth (388) have the highest SMRs over the period 1981-2000. The occupations with the highest PMRs are metal plate workers (PMR 503), vehicle body builders (526), plumbers and gas fitters (413) and carpenters (388).These data reinforce earlier findings that geographical areas and occupations associated with high exposure to asbestos in the past continue to drive the mesothelioma epidemic in Great Britain. However, the trends over time suggest a change in the balance of risk away from traditional asbestos exposure industries to industries where one could describe the exposure as secondary, such as plumbers and gas fitters, carpenters, and electricians.},

  Abstract                 = {For valid selection of subjects in "case-control" (case-referent) studies it is critical to understand that these studies do not represent an alternative to cohort studies but, rather, to census-ascertainment of the facts about the study base. Specifically, in these studies, the fact-finding scheme is to obtain a census of the study base with respect to outcome, and then a census of the cases together with a sample of the base to gather information on the determinant(s) as well as modifiers and confounders. If the base is defined a priori (primary base), then the challenge is to devise a scheme to obtain a census of the cases in it and a sample of the base itself ("control" or reference series) that is representative of it, conditional on the covariates that will be controlled in the analysis of the data. On the other hand, if the definition of the base is secondary, a corollary of the way the cases are selected, then the case series is best viewed as the totality of the cases in the base as a matter of definition. The corresponding secondary base is the population experience in which each potential case, had it occurred, would have been included in the case series. Representative sampling of a secondary base tends to call for the use of subjects coming to the source of cases because of other conditions--conditions whose occurrence is known to be unrelated to the determinant under study and whose diagnosis and referral to the source are known to have the same relation to the determinant as those of the illness under study. With both types of base, primary and secondary, the accuracy of the information on the determinant should be comparable between the case and reference series, and this requirement of comparability, just as that of representativeness, can have important implications for the selection of the study subjects.},

The characteristic findings on high-resolution computed tomography of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) are reticular abnormality and honeycombing with basal predominance. Honeycombing is a strong predictor of UIP and also is an important predictor of mortality. Because UIP carries the most adverse prognosis among the subtypes of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia, it is important to be able to differentiate this entity from nonspecific interstitial pneumonia and desquamative interstitial pneumonia from UIP, because these patients may show similar clinical presentations. A confident computed tomography diagnosis of UIP, in association with typical clinical features, will allow the clinician to avoid an unnecessary surgical biopsy.},

  Abstract                 = {A mineralogical analysis of lung tissue was conducted on 25 samples from patients who had been diagnosed as having idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) at low magnification and energy-dispersive x-ray analysis (EDXA) was used. In all samples, the surface silicon/sulfur (Si/S) ratio was calculated. The Si/S ratio for 25 samples of normal lung and 6 samples of pneumoconiotic lung was also determined (upper limit of normal Si/S ratio = 0.3). The difference between the Si/S ratio in the group with IPF and group with normal lung tissue was significantly significant (p less than .007, Wilcoxon test). Six of 12 patients with a previous diagnosis of IPF and a Si/S ratio greater than 0.3 had an exposure history that could imply inhalation of silica/silicates, and the correct diagnosis for these patients is most probably pneumoconiosis. The silica/silicate deposits detected in patients with IPF, and who had a ratio and no past exposure to dusts, could be either a cause or an effect of the disease.},

  Abstract                 = {The clinical features of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis can be indistinguishable; the need to eliminate occult environmental factors known to cause pulmonary fibrosis in patients suspected to have IPF during diagnostic evaluation is evident. We aimed to investigate occult, putative causes in the environments of patients diagnosed with IPF using tests beyond those conventionally used.In this case-cohort study, 60 consecutive patients diagnosed with IPF on the basis of the 2000 American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the European Respiratory Society (ERS) criteria were prospectively followed up every 4 months for 6 years between Jan 1, 2004, and Dec 31, 2009. At each visit a uniformly applied questionnaire was administered to these 60 patients to identify occult antigen exposure known to cause hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Patients underwent specific IgG determination, bronchoalveolar lavage, bronchial challenge testing with suspected antigens, and re-review of histopathological features in existing and subsequently obtained surgical lung biopsy samples and from lung explants. Specimens obtained from suspected sources from the patient's environment were subjected to cultures in microbiology laboratory. These clinical data and discussions among pulmonologists and radiologists familiar with IPF were used to confirm the diagnosis in accordance with 2011 ATS, ERS, Japanese Respiratory Society, and Latin American Thoracic Association guidelines; 46 of the 60 patients had IPF according to the 2011 guidelines, and our analyses in this study were focused on these 46 patients.20 of the 46 (43\%, 95\% CI 29-58) patients with IPF according to 2011 guidelines had a subsequent diagnosis of chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis: nine patients had positive bronchial challenge testing (eight of whom were also IgG positive and six of these patients also had surgical lung biopsy showing a pattern consistent with chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis); seven were IgG positive plus had histopathology on surgical lung biopsy that was consistent with hypersensitivity pneumonitis; one was IgG positive plus had greater than 20\% lymphocytes in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid; and three had findings on surgical lung biopsy that were consistent with subacute hypersensitivity pneumonitis (and IgG positive). Altogether, 29 of 46 patients diagnosed with IPF who had met the 2011 criteria had lung tissue available for histopathology (surgical lung biopsy in 28 patients and explanted lung in two patients, one of whom also had surgical biopsy) during the study period, and 16 of the 20 patients with chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis had histopathological features on surgical lung biopsy that were consistent with this diagnosis. 26 of the 46 patients remained with a diagnosis of IPF.Almost half of patients diagnosed with IPF on the basis of 2011 criteria were subsequently diagnosed with chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and most of these cases were attributed to exposure of occult avian antigens from commonly used feather bedding. Our results reflect findings in one centre with recognised expertise in chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and further research and studies at other centres are warranted.Fondo de Investigaciones Sanitarias; Fundació Privada Cellex; SEPAR 2010.},

All cases in the practice of two pulmonary specialists were identified. Cases were excluded if they were thought to have occupational exposures as a contributor, hypersensitivity pneumonitis or sarcoidosis, or some other well-recognized cause. Three controls were matched by sex and age (one year) as identified through orthopedic surgeons at the same institutions. Two rounds of a questionnaire were mailed; 17 cases (37.7\%) and 94 controls (32.4\%) responded to the questionnaire, although many of the case addresses were no longer valid. Individuals with ILD were 16.0 times as likely to report mold exposure and 11.1 times as likely to report silica as were controls in their workplace. Odds ratios associating ILD with moisture indicators in the home were in the same range as previously published associations between such indicators and wheezing. ILD may have environmental and occupational causes that warrant more systematic exploration.},

  Review                   = {1. Using ONS data: Over this period of time, three different ICD (International Classification of Diseases) codes were used to code death from IPF-CS. From 1965 to 1978, ICD-8 code 517 (other chronic interstitial pneumonia) From 1979 to 1999, ICD-9 codes 516.3 (idiopathic fibrosing alveolitis) and 515 (postinflammatory fibrosis) From 2000 onwards, ICD-10 code J84.1 (idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis) From 2010 onwards ICD-10 code Used population from England and Wales for each year for the years 1968-2008 as our denominators. For these analyses, the data on registered deaths and the general population were grouped into 5 year age bands over the age of 55 years and calendar periods were grouped into 5 year periods, but without combining years with different ICD codes. We calculated age- and sex stratum-specific mortality rates for each year and then applied these rates to the 2008 population to generate annual standardised mortality numbers. Poisson regression modelling was used to estimate annual mortality rate ratios with adjustment for sex and age. 2. Using THIN data: We calculated crude annual incidence rates, stratified by sex and age in 5 year age bands over the age of 55 years. Poisson regression modelling was applied to estimate annual incidence rate ratios, controlling for age, sex and health authority. 3. Survival analysis, individuals with IPF-CS were assigned a start date that was defined as the date of diagnosis and a stop date that was defined as the earliest of either the last THIN data collection or the date of death. In order to determine if mortality was changing over time, we calculated the median survival for this cohort overall and survival stratified by 2 year calendar periods using KaplaneMeir methods. Cox regression was used to compare mortality rates between the different age groups, sex and calendar periods. Multiplicative interaction terms were applied to test for interactions between mortality rates in the different calendar periods and age or sex},

  Abstract                 = {Laboratory studies suggest that the clotting cascade is activated in fibrotic lungs. Since humans vary in their tendency to clot due to a variety of inherited or acquired defects, we investigated whether a prothrombotic state increases the chance of developing idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and/or worsens the prognosis of IPF.We recruited 211 incident cases of IPF and 256 age- and sex-matched general population controls and collected data on medical history, medication, smoking habit, blood samples as well as lung function and high-resolution CT scans done as part of routine clinical care. A prothrombotic state was defined as the presence of at least one inherited or acquired clotting defect or marker of fibrinolytic dysfunction. We used logistic regression to quantify the association between a prothrombotic state and IPF adjusted for age, sex, smoking habit and highly sensitive C reactive protein. Cox regression was used to determine the influence of a prothrombotic state on survival.Cases were more than four times more likely than controls to have a prothrombotic state (OR 4.78, 95\% CI 2.93 to 7.80; p<0.0001). Cases with a prothrombotic state were also likely to have more severe disease (forced vital capacity <70\% predicted) at presentation (OR 10.79, 95\% CI 2.43 to 47.91) and had a threefold increased risk of death (HR 3.26, 95\% CI 1.09 to 9.75).People with IPF are more likely to have a prothrombotic state than general population controls and the presence of a prothrombotic state has an adverse impact on survival.},

  Abstract                 = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating disease that probably involves several genetic loci. Several rare genetic variants and one common single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of MUC5B have been associated with the disease. Our aim was to identify additional common variants associated with susceptibility and ultimately mortality in IPF.First, we did a three-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS): stage one was a discovery GWAS; and stages two and three were independent case-control studies. DNA samples from European-American patients with IPF meeting standard criteria were obtained from several US centres for each stage. Data for European-American control individuals for stage one were gathered from the database of genotypes and phenotypes; additional control individuals were recruited at the University of Pittsburgh to increase the number. For controls in stages two and three, we gathered data for additional sex-matched European-American control individuals who had been recruited in another study. DNA samples from patients and from control individuals were genotyped to identify SNPs associated with IPF. SNPs identified in stage one were carried forward to stage two, and those that achieved genome-wide significance (p<5?×?10(-8)) in a meta-analysis were carried forward to stage three. Three case series with follow-up data were selected from stages one and two of the GWAS using samples with follow-up data. Mortality analyses were done in these case series to assess the SNPs associated with IPF that had achieved genome-wide significance in the meta-analysis of stages one and two. Finally, we obtained gene-expression profiling data for lungs of patients with IPF from the Lung Genomics Research Consortium and analysed correlation with SNP genotypes.In stage one of the GWAS (542 patients with IPF, 542 control individuals matched one-by-one to cases by genetic ancestry estimates), we identified 20 loci. Six SNPs reached genome-wide significance in stage two (544 patients, 687 control individuals): three TOLLIP SNPs (rs111521887, rs5743894, rs5743890) and one MUC5B SNP (rs35705950) at 11p15.5; one MDGA2 SNP (rs7144383) at 14q21.3; and one SPPL2C SNP (rs17690703) at 17q21.31. Stage three (324 patients, 702 control individuals) confirmed the associations for all these SNPs, except for rs7144383. Linkage disequilibrium between the MUC5B SNP (rs35705950) and TOLLIP SNPs (rs111521887 [r(2)=0·07], rs5743894 [r(2)=0·16], and rs5743890 [r(2)=0·01]) was low. 683 patients from the GWAS were included in the mortality analysis. Individuals who developed IPF despite having the protective TOLLIP minor allele of rs5743890 carried an increased mortality risk (meta-analysis with fixed-effect model: hazard ratio 1·72 [95\% CI 1·24-2·38]; p=0·0012). TOLLIP expression was decreased by 20\% in individuals carrying the minor allele of rs5743890 (p=0·097), 40\% in those with the minor allele of rs111521887 (p=3·0?×?10(-4)), and 50\% in those with the minor allele of rs5743894 (p=2·93?×?10(-5)) compared with homozygous carriers of common alleles for these SNPs.Novel variants in TOLLIP and SPPL2C are associated with IPF susceptibility. One novel variant of TOLLIP, rs5743890, is also associated with mortality. These associations and the reduced expression of TOLLIP in patients with IPF who carry TOLLIP SNPs emphasise the importance of this gene in the disease.National Institutes of Health; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; Pulmonary Fibrosis Foundation; Coalition for Pulmonary Fibrosis; and Instituto de Salud Carlos III.},

  Abstract                 = {To determine patterns in asbestos-induced lung diseases found in older, less exposed workers.Review of a database evaluating lung function, smoking status, form of asbestos-induced lung disease, and radiograph abnormalities.Outpatient clinic.A total of 3383 asbestos-exposed workers referred for independent medical evaluation, including control subjects who lacked asbestos-specific radiograph abnormalities (n = 243), subjects with low International Labor Organization (ILO) scores (n = 2,685), high ILO scores (n = 312), bronchogenic cancer (n = 63), and mesothelioma (n = 80). Of these, 3,327 workers have specific smoking status information and 3,312 workers have lung volume measures.Chest radiographs were interpreted by a certified B-reader, and abnormalities were quantified according to the ILO scoring system. Spirometry and lung volume measurement were performed. Subjects completed a self-administered questionnaire that was reviewed at the time of examination. Control subjects were screened on two separate occasions at least 10 years apart to exclude subclinical or slowly progressive asbestos-induced lung disease.The mean age of the population was 65.1 +/- 9.9 years, and the latency was 41.4 +/- 10.1 years (+/- SD). Most subjects (41.8\%) had normal pulmonary function. Obstruction was the most common pulmonary function abnormality (25.4\%), followed by restriction (19.3\%) and a mixed pattern (6.0\%). Most subjects (79.4\%) had low ILO scores. Benign pleural abnormalities were the only findings in 54\% of subjects with low ILO score. Subjects with high ILO scores were older, smoked more, and had a longer latency than subjects with low ILO scores and control subjects. Smokers were younger, had a shorter latency, and had paradoxically greater ILO scores than nonsmokers. Subjects with bronchogenic cancer and mesothelioma had longer latencies than control subjects and subjects with benign asbestos-induced lung disease.Asbestos-induced lung disease today is characterized by low ILO scores, long latencies, greater disease magnitude in smokers, and a normal or obstructive pattern of pulmonary function abnormality. Spirometric evaluation in the absence of lung volume measurements caused misclassification that resulted in overestimation of the presence of a restrictive pattern of pulmonary function.},

  Abstract                 = {We followed a group of 85 Finnish asbestosis patients radiographically for an average of 6.5 (range 2-10) years to examine the progression of the disease and to assess possible explanations for the progression.The examinations included full-size chest radiographs and a blood specimen analysis. The radiographs were classified according to the 1980 International Labor Office (ILO) classification. Progression was accepted if the second or third radiography was estimated (in a side-by-side comparison) to have more profusion of small opacities qualitatively than the first, even if the radiographs were classified into the same profusion category.In all, 38\% of the patients showed progression during the follow-up period. The average progression of small opacities ranged from ILO 1/1 to ILO 2/2 (0.4 minor ILO categories/year). The asbestosis was progressive more often among the sprayers than among the insulators and asbestos factory workers [cross-tabulation, odds ratio (OR) 5.0, 95\% confidence interval (95\% CI) 1.2-20]. In the logistic regression model the ILO classification category at the beginning of the follow-up (OR 1.54; 95\% CI 0.96-2.47), the fibronectin (OR 1.01; 95\% CI 1.00-1.01) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE; OR 1.10; 95\% CI 1.00-1.20) levels, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR; OR 1.05; 95\% CI 1.00-1.10) were statistically associated with the radiographic progression of small opacities. Abnormalities of the pleura were found to progress more often among the patients with progressive parenchymal opacities.For the progression of small-opacity profusion the significant predictors in the logistic regression model were the ILO profusion category at the beginning of the follow-up period, the fibronectin level, the ACE value, and the ESR. The model correctly classified 94\% of the patients with progression and 65\% of those without progression. The differences in the mean values recorded for the biomarkers between the progressors and nonprogressors, however, were small and may therefore not be of any importance to the clinician.},

  Abstract                 = {National analyses of mortality in England and Wales have repeatedly shown excess deaths from pneumonia in welders. During 1979-90 the excess was attributable largely to deaths from lobar pneumonia and pneumonias other than bronchopneumonia, limited to men of working age and apparent in other occupations with exposure to metal fumes. The findings for 1991-2000 were assessed and compared with the mortality pattern from asthma in occupations exposed to known respiratory sensitisers.The Office of National Statistics supplied data on deaths by underlying cause among men aged 16-74 years in England and Wales during 1991-2000, including age and last held occupation. Data were abstracted on pneumonia for occupations with exposure to metal fumes and on asthma for occupations commonly reported to surveillance schemes as at risk of occupational asthma. The expected numbers of deaths were estimated by applying age-specific proportions of deaths by cause in the population to the total deaths by age in each occupational group. Observed and expected numbers were compared for each cause of death.Among men of working age in occupations with exposure to metal fumes there was excess mortality from pneumococcal and lobar pneumonia (54 deaths vs 27.3 expected) and from pneumonias other than bronchopneumonia (71 vs 52.4), but no excess from these causes at older ages or from bronchopneumonia at any age. The attributable mortality from metal fume exposure was 45.3 excess deaths compared with an estimated 62.6 deaths from occupational asthma.Exposure to metal fumes is a material cause of occupational mortality. The hazard deserves far more attention than it presently receives.},

  Abstract                 = {To test the hypothesis that inhalation of metal fume reversibly increases susceptibility to pneumonia, the authors conducted a case-control study. Men aged 20-64 years, admitted to 11 hospitals in West Midlands, England, with community-acquired pneumonia during 1996-1999 were interviewed about their lifetime occupational history, exposure to metal fume, and potential confounding factors. Similar information was collected from controls admitted to the same hospitals with nonrespiratory illness. For cases, exposures were timed relative to the onset of their illness (on average, 6 months before interview). Exposure histories for controls were censored 6 months before interview. Interviews were completed by 525 cases and 1,122 controls (response rates of 74\% and 99\%). Pneumonia was associated with reported occupational exposure to metal fume in the previous year (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 1.6, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.1, 2.4) but not in earlier periods (OR = 1.1). The risk was highest for lobar pneumonia and recent exposure to ferrous fume (OR = 2.3, 95\% CI: 1.2, 4.3). The association was not specific to any one microorganism. These findings support the hypothesis that ferrous and possibly other metal fumes reversibly predispose to infectious pneumonia. Research should now focus on the underlying mechanisms and prevention.},

  Abstract                 = {Metal and wood dust exposures have been identified as possible occupational risk factors for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). We analyzed mortality data using ICD-10 code J84.1--"Other interstitial pulmonary diseases with fibrosis," derived age-adjusted mortality rates for 1999-2003, and assessed occupational risks for 1999, by calculating proportionate mortality ratios (PMRs) and mortality odds ratios (MORs) using a matched case-control approach. We identified 84,010 IPF deaths, with an age-adjusted mortality rate of 75.7 deaths/million. Mortality rates were highest among males, whites, and those aged 85 and older. Three industry categories with potential occupational exposures recognized as risk factors for IPF were identified: "Wood buildings and mobile homes" (PMR = 4.5, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.2-11.6 and MOR = 5.3, 95\% CI 1.2-23.8), "Metal mining" (PMR = 2.4, 95\% CI 1.3-4.0 and MOR = 2.2, 95\% CI 1.1-4.4), and "Fabricated structural metal products" (PMR = 1.9, 95\% CI 1.1-3.1 and MOR = 1.7, 95\% CI 1.0-3.1). Workers in these industry categories may benefit from toxicological studies and improved surveillance for this disease.},

Male ORs (95\% confidence interval (CI)) relative to low-risk occupations for >10 years of exposure before the age of 30 years were 50.0 (25.8-96.8) for carpenters (LR 1 in 17), 17.1 (10.3-28.3) for plumbers, electricians and painters, 7.0 (3.2-15.2) for other construction workers, 15.3 (9.0-26.2) for other recognised high-risk occupations and 5.2 (3.1-8.5) in other industries where asbestos may be encountered. The LR was similar in apparently unexposed men and women (approximately 1 in 1000), and this was approximately doubled in exposed workers' relatives (OR 2.0, 95\% CI 1.3-3.2). No other environmental hazards were identified. In all, 14\% of male and 62\% of female cases were not attributable to occupational or domestic asbestos exposure. Approximately half of the male cases were construction workers, and only four had worked for more than 5 years in asbestos product manufacture.},

  Abstract                 = {Asbestosis is defined as diffuse pulmonary fibrosis caused by the inhalation of excessive amounts of asbestos fibers. Pathologically, both pulmonary fibrosis of a particular pattern and evidence of excess asbestos in the lungs must be present. Clinically, the disease usually progresses slowly, with a typical latent period of more than 20 years from first exposure to onset of symptoms.IDIOPATHIC PULMONARY FIBROSIS: The pulmonary fibrosis of asbestosis is interstitial and has a basal subpleural distribution, similar to that seen in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, which is the principal differential diagnosis. However, there are differences between the 2 diseases apart from the presence or absence of asbestos. First, the interstitial fibrosis of asbestosis is accompanied by very little inflammation, which, although not marked, is better developed in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Second, in keeping with the slow tempo of the disease, the fibroblastic foci that characterize idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis are infrequent in asbestosis. Third, asbestosis is almost always accompanied by mild fibrosis of the visceral pleura, a feature that is rare in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.RESPIRATORY BRONCHIOLITIS: Asbestosis is believed to start in the region of the respiratory bronchiole and gradually extends outward to involve more and more of the lung acinus, until the separate foci of fibrosis link, resulting in the characteristically diffuse pattern of the disease. These early stages of the disease are diagnostically problematic because similar centriacinar fibrosis is often seen in cigarette smokers and is characteristic of mixed-dust pneumoconiosis. Fibrosis limited to the walls of the bronchioles does not represent asbestosis.Histologic evidence of asbestos inhalation is provided by the identification of asbestos bodies either lying freely in the air spaces or embedded in the interstitial fibrosis. Asbestos bodies are distinguished from other ferruginous bodies by their thin, transparent core. Two or more asbestos bodies per square centimeter of a 5- mu m-thick lung section, in combination with interstitial fibrosis of the appropriate pattern, are indicative of asbestosis. Fewer asbestos bodies do not necessarily exclude a diagnosis of asbestosis, but evidence of excess asbestos would then require quantitative studies performed on lung digests.Quantification of asbestos load may be performed on lung digests or bronchoalveolar lavage material, employing either light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, or transmission electron microscopy. Whichever technique is employed, the results are only dependable if the laboratory is well practiced in the method chosen, frequently performs such analyses, and the results are compared with those obtained by the same laboratory applying the same technique to a control population.},

  Review                   = {An important differential diagnosis that arises in cases of asbestosis?especially when there is clinical-radiologic controversy about the diagnosis?is determining whether the disorder represents asbestosis or another interstitial disorder, such as one of the idiopathic interstitial pneumonias, especially UIP. One point of distinction is that UIP tends to be more rapidly progressive than asbestosis, which is usually either static or only slowly progressive,69 although cases of rapidly progressive asbestosis do occur.72 About 50% or fewer cases progress after cessation of asbestos exposure.67 Clinical asbestosis can be induced by cumulative asbestos exposure amounting to an estimated 25 fibers/ ml?yrs,31,67 and Browne73 and Churg74 have indicated that a ??dose?? in the range of 25 to 100 fibers/ml?yrs is required for the development of asbestosis. One Chinese study,75 based on chest radiographs of workers involved in the manufacture of asbestos products, found a 1% prevalence of grade I asbestosis (according to the Chinese system of grading), at a cumulative exposure of 22 fibers/ml?yrs. Green et al,76 in an autopsy study on the South Carolina asbestos textile workers, reported that histologic asbesto- sis was usually detectable with exposures in excess of 20 fibers/ml?yrs, and a few cases were found with estimated cumulative exposures of 10?20 fibers/ml?yrs (histologic examination being the most sensitive and specific means for the diagnosis of asbestosis). From an analysis of cases in the German Mesothelioma Register, Fischer et al77 reported that a requirement for asbestos exposure amounting to 25 fibers/ml?yrs for the diagnosis of asbestosis?including minimal histologic asbestosis? would lead to underrecognition of 42% of asbestosis cases and false-positive diagnoses in 24%.

  Abstract                 = {Asbestos exposure has resulted in a variety of diseases, including asbestosis, carcinoma of the lung (LC), pleural plaques, and malignant mesothelioma (MM). We hypothesized that there have been significant changes in the mineral fiber content of lung tissue from individuals with these diseases over the past 25 years. Asbestos content was measured in lung tissue samples from 819 individuals using light microscopy (to measure asbestos body concentrations) and scanning electron microscopy (to measure types and concentrations of mineral fibers). Cases were divided chronologically according to those occurring in the first half (group 1) versus those occurring in the second half (group 2). The study included 419 cases of MM, 206 cases of asbestosis, and 340 cases of LC. The median asbestos body count (in asbestos bodies per gram) decreased from group 1 to group 2 for each disease: MM, 480 to 350; asbestosis, 24700 to 19200; and LC, 1600 to 174 (reference range, 0-20). A similar trend was observed for fiber counts by scanning electron microscopy. Amosite was the most frequently detected asbestos fiber type and decreased in frequency of detection and median concentration from group 1 to group 2. Crocidolite showed an increased detection frequency from group 1 to group 2 across all 3 disease categories. The decrease in asbestos body and amosite concentrations over time is consistent with the banning of asbestos from insulation products in 1972. The source for the increased detection of crocidolite was not identified and needs further investigation.},

This article reports further results pertaining to response to treatment and survival.Data on the treatment given and lung function response were collected over 4-6 years. Survival data were collected over 10 years.Treatment was given to 445 (76\%) patients, 55\% were given prednisolone alone and the remainder another immunosuppressive agent, usually with prednisolone. Treated patients had worse lung function initially. At 3 months after study entry, treated patients were more likely to have improved forced vital capacity (FVC) than the untreated patients. Patients whose FVC improved were younger (p = 0.001 analysis of variance (ANOVA)) and had lower initial FVC (p<0.001, ANOVA). Patients who responded to treatment at 3 months or at 1 year survived longer than those who remained stable, who in turn survived longer than those who deteriorated (p = 0.002). These differences were largely accounted for by patients with better lung function surviving longer. Younger age at entry, female sex and higher percentage predicted FVC and carbon monoxide transfer factor [corrected] at study entry were associated with greater chances of survival at 4 years. Overall median survival from entry was 2.43 years (95\% confidence interval (CI) 2.17 to 3.18).About a third of patients with CFA showed improved lung function after initiation of corticosteroid or immunosuppressive treatment, and those who improved survived longer. Poorer lung function, male sex and age are adverse prognostic features. Overall survival was poor.},

We evaluated airway and parenchymal pathology using standardized diagnostic criteria and semiquantitative grading schemata, including the grading of small airways for fibrosis and birefringent mineral dust particles. We analyzed lung dust burden on a subset of 37 lungs following bleach digestion, using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray spectrometry (XRS) and image analysis, and by X-ray diffraction for crystalline silica (CSi). Farmworkers comprised 51.5\% and nonfarmworkers 48.5\% of the samples.Proximal airways demonstrated little mineral dust accumulation, but membranous and respiratory bronchioles had wall thickening, remodeling, and inflammation associated with carbonaceous and mineral dust deposition. These changes were independently associated with agricultural work, cigarette smoking, and increased age. Mineral dust small airways disease, pneumoconiosis (macules and nodules), and pathologic changes consistent with chronic bronchitis, emphysema, and interstitial fibrosis predominated in farmworkers compared with nonfarmworkers. CSi, determined gravimetrically, and aluminum silicate particles, determined by SEM/XRS, were increased in the lungs of farmworkers compared with nonfarmworkers and were significantly (p < 0.05) associated with small airway disease and pneumoconiosis.Mineral dust exposure is associated with increased small airway disease and pneumoconiosis among California farmworkers; however, the clinical significance and natural history of these changes remains to be determined.},

  Abstract                 = {The mutations that have been implicated in pulmonary fibrosis account for only a small proportion of the population risk.Using a genomewide linkage scan, we detected linkage between idiopathic interstitial pneumonia and a 3.4-Mb region of chromosome 11p15 in 82 families. We then evaluated genetic variation in this region in gel-forming mucin genes expressed in the lung among 83 subjects with familial interstitial pneumonia, 492 subjects with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and 322 controls. MUC5B expression was assessed in lung tissue.Linkage and fine mapping were used to identify a region of interest on the p-terminus of chromosome 11 that included gel-forming mucin genes. The minor-allele of the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs35705950, located 3 kb upstream of the MUC5B transcription start site, was present at a frequency of 34\% among subjects with familial interstitial pneumonia, 38\% among subjects with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and 9\% among controls (allelic association with familial interstitial pneumonia, P=1.2×10(-15); allelic association with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, P=2.5×10(-37)). The odds ratios for disease among subjects who were heterozygous and those who were homozygous for the minor allele of this SNP were 6.8 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 3.9 to 12.0) and 20.8 (95\% CI, 3.8 to 113.7), respectively, for familial interstitial pneumonia and 9.0 (95\% CI, 6.2 to 13.1) and 21.8 (95\% CI, 5.1 to 93.5), respectively, for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. MUC5B expression in the lung was 14.1 times as high in subjects who had idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis as in those who did not (P<0.001). The variant allele of rs35705950 was associated with up-regulation in MUC5B expression in the lung in unaffected subjects (expression was 37.4 times as high as in unaffected subjects homozygous for the wild-type allele, P<0.001). MUC5B protein was expressed in lesions of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.A common polymorphism in the promoter of MUC5B is associated with familial interstitial pneumonia and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Our findings suggest that dysregulated MUC5B expression in the lung may be involved in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis. (Funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and others.).},

Significant predictors of disease progression were found by a linear stepwise regression analysis from among such variables as smoking history, latency (time since first exposure), duration and intensity of exposure, and cytology.Although most radiographs remained normal, some showed progression of disease with about twice as many patients with abnormalities on the last film. Various combinations of age, intensity of exposure, and time between films were significant predictors of pleural and parenchymal disease and progression of such disease. No predominance of one sided disease was noted. Cytology and smoking were unreliable predictors of disease. Most disease progression was minor, usually of less than two scoring categories.An intense, yet short, exposure to amosite asbestos can produce pleural and parenchymal changes on chest radiographs. The number of those affected roughly doubled over a period spanning 10 to 20 years after exposure. Age and intensity of exposure are the most important predictors of disease.},

Chest radiographs revealed both small rounded and small irregular opacities. Small irregular opacities on chest radiographs often proved to be reticular or honeycomb patterns on CT scans. Irregular opacities seen on CR and CT images represented interstitial fibrotic or mixed dust fibrotic changes associated with the accumulation of birefringent particles and emphysematous change, as noted at histologic analysis. CT scans and scintigrams were useful for visualizing parenchymal abnormalities, especially fibrotic change, emphysematous change, and pleural abnormalities.},

Survivors were offered a follow-up evaluation.Morbidity and mortality related to AEP.There were 18 cases of AEP identified among 183,000 military personnel deployed in or near Iraq during the study period, yielding an AEP incidence of 9.1 per 100,000 person-years (95\% confidence interval, 4.3-13.3). The majority of patients (89\%) were men and the median age was 22 (range, 19-47) years. All patients used tobacco, with 78\% recently beginning to smoke. All but 1 reported significant exposure to fine airborne sand or dust. Known causes of pulmonary eosinophilia (eg, drug exposures or parasitic disease) were not identified. Epidemiologic investigation revealed no evidence of a common source exposure, temporal or geographic clustering, person-to-person transmission, or an association with recent vaccination. Six patients underwent bronchoalveolar lavage (median eosinophilia of 40.5\%). All patients developed peripheral eosinophilia (range, 8\%-42\%). Mechanical ventilation was required in 67\% for a median of 7 (range, 2-16) days. Two soldiers died; the remainder responded to corticosteroids and/or supportive care. Twelve individuals were reevaluated a median of 3 months after diagnosis. At that point, 3 patients reported mild dyspnea and 1 reported wheezing. All patients had finished treatment and had either normal or nearly normal spirometry results. None had recurrent eosinophilia.AEP occurred at an increased rate among this deployed military population and resulted in 2 deaths. Failure to consider AEP in the differential diagnosis of respiratory failure in military personnel can result in missing this syndrome and possibly death. The etiology of AEP remains unclear, but the association with new-onset smoking suggests a possible link.},

There was HIPAA compliance for all U.S. patients. The study included 66 patients (36 men, 30 women; mean age, 58.8 years +/- 10.9 [standard deviation]) with proved chronic HP (n = 18), IPF (n = 23), or NSIP (n = 25) who underwent CT. Two independent readers assessed the CT images, made a first-choice diagnosis, and noted the degree of confidence in the diagnosis. A general linear model was used to identify CT features that independently differentiated chronic HP from IPF and NSIP. Weighted kappa statistic was used to assess interobserver agreement.The CT features that best differentiated chronic HP were lobular areas with decreased attenuation and vascularity, centrilobular nodules, and absence of lower zone predominance of abnormalities (P < or = .008). The features that best differentiated NSIP were relative subpleural sparing, absence of lobular areas with decreased attenuation, and lack of honeycombing (P < or = .002). The features that best differentiated IPF were basal predominance of honeycombing, absence of relative subpleural sparing, and absence centrilobular nodules (P < or = .004). A confident diagnosis was made in 70 (53\%) of 132 readings. This diagnosis was correct in 66 (94\%) of 70 readings. The accuracy for the entire cohort was 80\%. Interobserver agreement for confident diagnosis was good to excellent (kappa = 0.77-0.96).Characteristic CT features of chronic HP, IPF, and NSIP allow confident distinction between these entities in approximately 50\% of patients.},

The World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated that 107,000 people worldwide die each year from mesothelioma, lung cancer, and asbestosis. We review what is known about asbestos use, production, and exposure and asbestos-related diseases in the world today, and we offer predictions for the future. Although worldwide consumption of asbestos has decreased, consumption is increasing in many developing countries. The limited data available suggest that exposures may also be high in developing countries. Mesothelioma is still increasing in most European countries and in Japan but has peaked in the United States and Sweden. Although the epidemic of asbestos-related disease has plateaued or is expected to plateau in most of the developed world, little is known about the epidemic in developing countries. It is obvious that increased asbestos use by these countries will result in an increase in asbestos-related diseases in the future.},

The patients' ages ranged from 45 to 74 years at the time of study. None of the patients had asbestosis. The distribution of fibres and dust content of the lungs showed a log-normal distribution. There was no significant difference in fibre counts or dust content between men and women, and between lung cancer and non-cancer patients. The only group with an association with a high asbestos fibre count was four necropsy cases of pleural mesothelioma. There was no significant relationship between asbestos fibre count and dust content of the lung. The present data suggest that asbestos fibre counts below 100,000 per gram of dried lung are not related to specific asbestos disease, although in the surgical cases who were closely questioned on their residential and occupational histories most of those with fibre counts above 30,000 per gram dried lung had had occasions of definite or very likely asbestos exposure.},

  Abstract                 = {Of the idiopathic lung diseases, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and sarcoidosis have been the focus of a growing number of epidemiological investigations on the risk of environmental and occupational exposures. To date, the consistency of epidemiological evidence is suggestive of a causal relationship between several environmental exposures and IPF, with the strongest evidence for cigarette smoking and metal dust. Current knowledge about pathogenesis provides further support for a causal link. However, scant epidemiological evidence for dose-response and temporality weaken the case for making causal inferences. In contrast to IPF, the quantity of epidemiological evidence for environmental exposures and sarcoidosis is smaller. Two studies provide consistent evidence for exposures to agricultural dust and musty odor/mold/mildew, and studies among military personnel and firefighters suggest mixed dust and fume exposures as risk factors for sarcoidosis. Although studies of the pathogenesis of sarcoidosis also provide evidence supporting environmental causation, more epidemiological studies are needed to establish consistency of associations, dose-response, and temporality. Future investigations, of gene-environment interaction offer the potential for strengthening the evidence of causation between several environmental and occupational exposures and idiopathic lung diseases.},

Given the variable quality of current exposure assessment techniques, we suggest methods to improve assessments, including the incorporation of hygiene measurements: using data from administrative exposure databases; using results of studies identifying determinants of exposure to develop questionnaires; and where reasonable given latency and biological half life considerations, directly measuring exposures of study subjects.},

  Abstract                 = {In 2002 the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society (ATS/ERS) classification of idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IIPs) defined seven specific entities, and provided standardized terminology and diagnostic criteria. In addition, the historical "gold standard" of histologic diagnosis was replaced by a multidisciplinary approach. Since 2002 many publications have provided new information about IIPs.The objective of this statement is to update the 2002 ATS/ERS classification of IIPs.An international multidisciplinary panel was formed and developed key questions that were addressed through a review of the literature published between 2000 and 2011.Substantial progress has been made in IIPs since the previous classification. Nonspecific interstitial pneumonia is now better defined. Respiratory bronchiolitis-interstitial lung disease is now commonly diagnosed without surgical biopsy. The clinical course of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and nonspecific interstitial pneumonia is recognized to be heterogeneous. Acute exacerbation of IIPs is now well defined. A substantial percentage of patients with IIP are difficult to classify, often due to mixed patterns of lung injury. A classification based on observed disease behavior is proposed for patients who are difficult to classify or for entities with heterogeneity in clinical course. A group of rare entities, including pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis and rare histologic patterns, is introduced. The rapidly evolving field of molecular markers is reviewed with the intent of promoting additional investigations that may help in determining diagnosis, and potentially prognosis and treatment.This update is a supplement to the previous 2002 IIP classification document. It outlines advances in the past decade and potential areas for future investigation.},

  abstract        = {The history of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) shows that the disease may be preceded by a viral-like illness. Although viruses have not been demonstrated, it is possible that viruses were not detected in culture because they do not replicate during latency. We investigated the presence of adenovirus in IPF and interstitial pneumonia associated with collagen vascular disease (CVD-IP), using the nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and in situ hybridization (ISH) for the E1A region of the adenovirus genome. Studies were performed on lung tissues obtained by transbronchial lung biopsy from 19 patients with IPF, 10 patients with CVD-IP and, for comparison, 20 patients with sarcoidosis. The E1A DNA was present in 3 out of 19 (16%) cases of IPF, in 5 of 10 (50%) cases of CVD-IP, and in 2 of 20 (10%) cases of sarcoidosis. The incidence of E1A DNA in CVD-IP was significantly higher than that in sarcoidosis (p < 0.05). In patients with IPF and CVD-IP, E1A DNA was more prevalent in patients treated with corticosteroids (6 out of 9 cases; 67%) than in those without it (2 out of 20 cases; 10%) (p < 0.01). ISH studies showed that 1 out of 8 cases of IPF and CVD-IP, in which E1A DNA was detected by PCR, was positive for E1A DNA. We conclude that adenovirus E1A is unlikely to be aetiologically involved in the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis or interstitial pneumonia associated with collagen vascular disease. However, a latent adenovirus infection may be reactivated or may newly infect the host following corticosteroid administration.},

  Abstract                 = {Several clinical trials have recently targeted specific pathways implicated in the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). However, IPF remains plagued by a median survival of 3 yrs and emphasises the need for further research with new insights and perspectives. The prevailing pathogenic hypotheses assume that either an inflammatory process or an independent epithelial/fibroblastic disorder may propagate the disease process. Based on knowledge developed with considerable scientific evidence, we provide our perspectives with an alternative point of view that IPF be considered as a neoproliferative disorder of the lung. Genetic alterations, response to growth and inhibitory signals, resistance to apoptosis, myofibroblast origin and behaviour, altered cellular communications, and intracellular signalling pathways are all fundamental pathogenic hallmarks of both IPF and cancer. The concept of IPF as a lethal malignant disorder of the lung might extend beyond the pathogenic link between these two diseases and disclose new pathogenic mechanisms leading to novel therapeutic options, adopted from cancer biology. Moreover, this vision might dawn the awareness of the public, political and scientific community of this devastating disease from an angle different from the current perception and provoke new ideas and studies to get a better understanding to control the otherwise relentless progressive disease.},

Wacholder et al. Am J Epidemiol 1992;135:1029-50). In this paper, a theoretical framework for selecting controls in case-control studies is developed. Three principles of comparability are described: 1) study base, that all comparisons be made within the study base; 2) deconfounding, that comparisons of the effects of the levels of exposure on disease risk not be distorted by the effects of other factors; and 3) comparable accuracy, that any errors in measurement of exposure be nondifferential between cases and controls. These principles, if adhered to in a study, can reduce selection, confounding, and information bias, respectively. The principles, however, are constrained by an additional efficiency principle regarding resources and time. Most problems and controversies in control selection reflect trade-offs among these four principles.},

The occupational exposure to mineral dust has been coded for 189 of these cases. There is good correlation between the severity of asbestosis and the coded exposures, electron microscopic mineral fibre count, and the fibre count as seen under the light microscope.

  Abstract                 = {This report presents data gathered from a series of asbestos disease screening examinations of 9,605 United States sheet metal workers who were first employed in the trade at least 20 years before the examination. The overall prevalence of asbestos-related radiographic changes was 31.1\%: 18.8\% had pleural abnormalities alone, 6.6\% had parenchymal abnormalities (International Labour Office (ILO) score of 1/0 or higher) alone, and 5.7\% had both. Among those with 40 years or more since entering the trade, 41.5\% had radiographic signs of asbestos-related disease, 24.2\% pleural alone, 7.7\% parenchymal alone, and 9.6\% both pleural and parenchymal abnormalities. After controlling for several surrogates for asbestos exposure level, cigarette smoking was found to increase risk of parenchymal, and more modestly, pleural abnormalities. Each pack-year was associated with a 1\% increased prevalence odds ratios for parenchymal abnormalities (ILO category 1 compared to category 0), and 0.4\% increased prevalence odds ratios for pleural abnormalities. A history of shipyard employment also produced significantly increased prevalence odds ratios for each radiographic category. More that 90\% of chest radiographs were classified by A or B readers; after adjustment for other risk factors, A readers were more likely to report parenchymal abnormalities of category 1, but not more likely to report category 2 or pleural abnormalities, than B readers.},

This article explores the epidemiologic and clinical challenges to establishing exposure associations, the current literature regarding exposure disease relationships and the diagnostic work-up of IPF and asbestosis patients. IPF patients demonstrate a histopathologic pattern of usual interstitial pneumonia. In the absence of a known cause or association, a usual interstitial pneumonia pattern leads to an IPF diagnosis, which is a progressive and often terminal fibrotic lung disease. It has long been recognized that asbestos exposure can cause pathologic and radiographic changes indistinguishable from IPF. Several epidemiologic studies, primarily case control in design, have found that a number of other exposures that can increase risk of developing IPF include cigarette smoke, wood dust, metal dust, sand/silica and agricultural exposures. Lung mineralogic analyses have provided additional support to causal associations. Genetic variation may explain differences in disease susceptibility among the population. An accumulating body of literature suggests that occupational and environmental exposure can contribute to the development of IPF. The impact of exposure on the pathogenesis and clinical course of disease requires further study.},

The aim of the study is to describe the epidemiologic, clinical, physiologic, and laboratory features of PAP in a large single-center cohort of patients with PAP. Over 30 years, 70 patients with PAP were managed at our institution, 64 with primary and 6 with secondary PAP. The mean age at diagnosis was 43 years with a male to female ratio of 1.3. BAL was the most commonly applied diagnostic method, performed in 83% of cases. A history of smoking was seen in 79%, and of dust exposure in 54%, most commonly to aluminum, silica and sawdust. GM-CSF autoantibody correlated with clinical outcome and KL-6 with diffusing capacity. The number of whole lung lavages (WLL) necessary to reach remission was higher in current smokers. This study shows that the use of BAL for the diagnosis of PAP can reduce the need of histological confirmation. A history of dust or fume inhalation is strongly associated with PAP, also with the autoimmune form. Smoking seems to influence the response to treatment, increasing the number of WLL necessary to reach remission.},

  abstract        = {Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a rare, diffuse infiltrative lung disease of unknown etiology characterized by accumulation of abnormal lung surfactant in the alveoli and distal airways. Although it was first described in 1958, few large scale studies have been published. The diagnosis is conventionally based on lung biopsy and the value of less invasive procedures such as bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) remains controversial. A multi-center retrospective study was conducted in an attempt to update epidemiological, clinical and long term outcome and to assess the usefulness of chest CT scan and BAL in the management of a large homogeneous series of 41 patients. Inclusion criteria required a clinical picture compatible with PAP and either histological confirmation, or a BAL with a milky macroscopic appearance coupled with positive staining to PAS. Mean age was 48.8 years with a 4: 1 male predominance. The prevalence of smokers (80%) and occupational exposure to various inhaled dusts (39%) was high. The clinical, roentgenographic and functional features were in keeping with previous series. Worsening dyspnea was the most common symptom. Other common manifestations were dry cough, recurrent lung infections, weight loss, finger clubbing, crackles and cyanosis. LDH serum levels were increased in 51% of cases. Lung function tests usually showed a mild restrictive ventilatory defect with hypoxemia and reduced DLCO. Chest X ray revealed bilateral ground glass opacities with consolidation or air bronchogram involving peri-hilar or lower lobes. Chest CT scan, performed in 38 patients, revealed a similar pattern in most of them with diffuse intra-alveolar ground glass opacities (33/38) and interlobular thickening (35/38), resulting in a crazy paving appearance in the typical geographic pattern (32/38). This latter aspect was highly suggestive of the diagnosis. Segmental BAL led to a definitive diagnosis in 62% and lung biopsy was only required in 38% of cases. These data suggest that careful BAL analysis can be sufficient to provide a diagnosis without the need for a lung biopsy. During follow-up, spontaneous remission or improvement was reported in 26%. Segmental (n=3) or whole lung lavage (n=22) was required in 62.5% with a favorable course (complete remission 37%, improvement 34%, stable course 21%) in 92% of the cases. In this series the overall prognosis for PAP remained good, although unpredictable.},

To describe the epidemiologic, clinical, physiologic, and laboratory features of autoimmune PAP in a large, contemporaneous cohort of patients with PAP. Over 6 years, 248 patients with PAP were enrolled in a Japanese national registry, including 223 with autoimmune PAP.

The male to female ratio was 2.1:1, and the median age at diagnosis was 51 years. A history of smoking occurred in 56%, and dust exposure occurred in 23%; instances of familial onset did not occur.

The aim of the study is to describe the epidemiologic, clinical, physiologic, and laboratory features of PAP in a large single-center cohort of patients with PAP. Over 30 years, 70 patients with PAP were managed at our institution, 64 with primary and 6 with secondary PAP. The mean age at diagnosis was 43 years with a male to female ratio of 1.3. BAL was the most commonly applied diagnostic method, performed in 83% of cases. A history of smoking was seen in 79%, and of dust exposure in 54%, most commonly to aluminum, silica and sawdust. GM-CSF autoantibody correlated with clinical outcome and KL-6 with diffusing capacity. The number of whole lung lavages (WLL) necessary to reach remission was higher in current smokers. This study shows that the use of BAL for the diagnosis of PAP can reduce the need of histological confirmation. A history of dust or fume inhalation is strongly associated with PAP, also with the autoimmune form. Smoking seems to influence the response to treatment, increasing the number of WLL necessary to reach remission.},

  abstract        = {Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a rare, diffuse infiltrative lung disease of unknown etiology characterized by accumulation of abnormal lung surfactant in the alveoli and distal airways. Although it was first described in 1958, few large scale studies have been published. The diagnosis is conventionally based on lung biopsy and the value of less invasive procedures such as bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) remains controversial. A multi-center retrospective study was conducted in an attempt to update epidemiological, clinical and long term outcome and to assess the usefulness of chest CT scan and BAL in the management of a large homogeneous series of 41 patients. Inclusion criteria required a clinical picture compatible with PAP and either histological confirmation, or a BAL with a milky macroscopic appearance coupled with positive staining to PAS. Mean age was 48.8 years with a 4: 1 male predominance. The prevalence of smokers (80%) and occupational exposure to various inhaled dusts (39%) was high. The clinical, roentgenographic and functional features were in keeping with previous series. Worsening dyspnea was the most common symptom. Other common manifestations were dry cough, recurrent lung infections, weight loss, finger clubbing, crackles and cyanosis. LDH serum levels were increased in 51% of cases. Lung function tests usually showed a mild restrictive ventilatory defect with hypoxemia and reduced DLCO. Chest X ray revealed bilateral ground glass opacities with consolidation or air bronchogram involving peri-hilar or lower lobes. Chest CT scan, performed in 38 patients, revealed a similar pattern in most of them with diffuse intra-alveolar ground glass opacities (33/38) and interlobular thickening (35/38), resulting in a crazy paving appearance in the typical geographic pattern (32/38). This latter aspect was highly suggestive of the diagnosis. Segmental BAL led to a definitive diagnosis in 62% and lung biopsy was only required in 38% of cases. These data suggest that careful BAL analysis can be sufficient to provide a diagnosis without the need for a lung biopsy. During follow-up, spontaneous remission or improvement was reported in 26%. Segmental (n=3) or whole lung lavage (n=22) was required in 62.5% with a favorable course (complete remission 37%, improvement 34%, stable course 21%) in 92% of the cases. In this series the overall prognosis for PAP remained good, although unpredictable.},

The aim of the study is to describe the epidemiologic, clinical, physiologic, and laboratory features of PAP in a large single-center cohort of patients with PAP. Over 30 years, 70 patients with PAP were managed at our institution, 64 with primary and 6 with secondary PAP. The mean age at diagnosis was 43 years with a male to female ratio of 1.3. BAL was the most commonly applied diagnostic method, performed in 83% of cases. A history of smoking was seen in 79%, and of dust exposure in 54%, most commonly to aluminum, silica and sawdust. GM-CSF autoantibody correlated with clinical outcome and KL-6 with diffusing capacity. The number of whole lung lavages (WLL) necessary to reach remission was higher in current smokers. This study shows that the use of BAL for the diagnosis of PAP can reduce the need of histological confirmation. A history of dust or fume inhalation is strongly associated with PAP, also with the autoimmune form. Smoking seems to influence the response to treatment, increasing the number of WLL necessary to reach remission.},

  abstract        = {Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a rare, diffuse infiltrative lung disease of unknown etiology characterized by accumulation of abnormal lung surfactant in the alveoli and distal airways. Although it was first described in 1958, few large scale studies have been published. The diagnosis is conventionally based on lung biopsy and the value of less invasive procedures such as bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) remains controversial. A multi-center retrospective study was conducted in an attempt to update epidemiological, clinical and long term outcome and to assess the usefulness of chest CT scan and BAL in the management of a large homogeneous series of 41 patients. Inclusion criteria required a clinical picture compatible with PAP and either histological confirmation, or a BAL with a milky macroscopic appearance coupled with positive staining to PAS. Mean age was 48.8 years with a 4: 1 male predominance. The prevalence of smokers (80%) and occupational exposure to various inhaled dusts (39%) was high. The clinical, roentgenographic and functional features were in keeping with previous series. Worsening dyspnea was the most common symptom. Other common manifestations were dry cough, recurrent lung infections, weight loss, finger clubbing, crackles and cyanosis. LDH serum levels were increased in 51% of cases. Lung function tests usually showed a mild restrictive ventilatory defect with hypoxemia and reduced DLCO. Chest X ray revealed bilateral ground glass opacities with consolidation or air bronchogram involving peri-hilar or lower lobes. Chest CT scan, performed in 38 patients, revealed a similar pattern in most of them with diffuse intra-alveolar ground glass opacities (33/38) and interlobular thickening (35/38), resulting in a crazy paving appearance in the typical geographic pattern (32/38). This latter aspect was highly suggestive of the diagnosis. Segmental BAL led to a definitive diagnosis in 62% and lung biopsy was only required in 38% of cases. These data suggest that careful BAL analysis can be sufficient to provide a diagnosis without the need for a lung biopsy. During follow-up, spontaneous remission or improvement was reported in 26%. Segmental (n=3) or whole lung lavage (n=22) was required in 62.5% with a favorable course (complete remission 37%, improvement 34%, stable course 21%) in 92% of the cases. In this series the overall prognosis for PAP remained good, although unpredictable.},

Because PAP is rare, prior reports were based on limited patient numbers or a synthesis of historical data. To describe the epidemiologic, clinical, physiologic, and laboratory features of autoimmune PAP in a large, contemporaneous cohort of patients with PAP. Over 6 years, 248 patients with PAP were enrolled in a Japanese national registry, including 223 with autoimmune PAP. Autoimmune PAP represented 89.9% of cases and had a minimum incidence and prevalence of 0.49 and 6.2 per million, respectively. The male to female ratio was 2.1:1, and the median age at diagnosis was 51 years. A history of smoking occurred in 56%, and dust exposure occurred in 23%; instances of familial onset did not occur. Dyspnea was the most common presenting symptom, occurring in 54.3%. Importantly, 31.8% of patients were asymptomatic and were identified by health screening. Intercurrent illnesses, including infections, were infrequent. A disease severity score reflecting the presence of symptoms and degree of hypoxemia correlated well with carbon monoxide diffusing capacity and serum biomarkers, less well with pulmonary function, and not with granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor autoantibody levels or duration of disease. Autoimmune PAP had an incidence and prevalence higher than previously reported and was not strongly linked to smoking, occupational exposure, or other illnesses. The disease severity score and biomarkers provide novel and potentially useful outcome measures in PAP.},

However, in respiratory epidemiology this has been analysed in very few recently published papers. The aim of our paper is to assess if the results found in our previous postal questionnaire study in an adult population in Northern Finland were biased by non-response.A random sample of 385 persons from the 1,284 non-responders in a previous postal questionnaire study was examined. The same questionnaire as in the original study was again mailed to these persons, and those still not answering were contacted by phone.Totally 183 complete answers (48\%) were collected. Lack of interest (56\%) and forgetting to mail the response letter (22\%) were the most common reasons to non-response. Typical non-responders were young men and current smokers who less frequently reported respiratory symptoms in exercise and asthma than the responders in the original study. Answers collected by phone gave for some questions higher prevalence rates than postal answers.Firstly, in this population the response rate (83.6\%) in the original study was high enough to provide reliable results for respiratory symptoms and diseases, only the prevalence of current smoking was biased by non-response. Secondly, the methods used for collecting responses in a non-response study may influence the results.},

Three principles of comparability are described: 1) study base, that all comparisons be made within the study base; 2) deconfounding, that comparisons of the effects of the levels of exposure on disease risk not be distorted by the effects of other factors; and 3) comparable accuracy, that any errors in measurement of exposure be nondifferential between cases and controls. These principles, if adhered to in a study, can reduce selection, confounding, and information bias, respectively. The principles, however, are constrained by an additional efficiency principle regarding resources and time. Most problems and controversies in control selection reflect trade-offs among these four principles.},

Bronchiolocentric interstitial pneumonia has a marked predilection for women (80\%) and occurs in middle age (40-50 years). Chest radiographs and pulmonary function tests show interstitial and restrictive lung disease, while the histologic appearance is that of a centrilobular inflammatory process with small airway fibrosis and inflammation that radiates into the interstitium of the distal acinus in a patchy fashion. Granulomas are not identified. At a mean followup of approximately 4 years in nine patients, 33\% of patients were dead of disease and 56\% had persistent or progressive disease suggesting a more aggressive course than hypersensitivity pneumonitis and nonspecific interstitial pneumonia, the two major disease processes in the differential diagnosis. Whether Bronchiolocentric interstitial pneumonia is a unique entity or not, the pattern of bronchiocentric injury to the lung in the absence of known causes and its clinical presentation as interstitial lung disease, warrants further investigation of this unusual interstitial process.},

  abstract    = {Anthracofibrosis, which was recently defined as bronchial stenosis with overlying anthracotic mucosa, has been infrequently reported in Asia as a complication of tuberculosis (TB). It has not been reported in the United Kingdom or the United States, or, to our knowledge, in non-Asian patients. We have identified seven cases of patients presenting to a single teaching hospital in the northwest of England over a 13-year period. Only one patient had a history of TB, but six of the seven patients had a history of occupational dust exposure, including one patient with pneumoconiosis. It is possible that anthracofibrosis is an exaggerated endobronchial form of the much more common condition of anthracosis in coal miners and other workers who have been exposed to mineral dusts. Our study suggests that this is essentially a benign condition, although it may progress very slowly, leading to gradually progressive bronchial stenosis. The diagnosis is important because most patients have clinical, radiologic, and bronchoscopic changes that are highly suspicious of malignancy.},

The carbon arc deposits were visible in histological sections as small granules within macrophages of the tracheobronchial lymph nodes and hepatic Kupffer's cells. Electron microprobe analysis by energy dispersive analysis of x-rays showed the granules to be composed of the rare earth elements cerium, lanthanum and neodymium, which are the major constituents of carbon arc rods. Tissue concentrations, as determined by inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy, were approximately 250-2000 times those of unexposed controls, and there was evidence of their redistribution throughout the reticuloendothelial system. There were no respiratory symptoms, or radiographic or histological pulmonary changes attributable to the progressive accumulation of the rare earth elements, and as such the patient cannot be considered to have suffered from pneumoconiosis. Twenty-one published cases of rare earth pneumoconiosis, mainly in photoengravers exposed to carbon arc fumes, are reviewed and suggest that rare earth oxides are not innocuous dusts. With the increasingly widespread use of rare earth elements there is a likelhood that further occupational groups may have significant but unrecognised exposure.},

In addition to other elements, levels of thorium (Th), which is generally present as an impurity of RE compounds, were also determined to estimate the radiation dose which may be involved in inducing pneumoconiosis. The results show that the levels of Th are more than two orders of magnitude lower than the maximum permissible concentration for occupational exposure to natural 232Th, suggesting that the long-term accumulation of RE in the lungs played a role in the pathogenesis of the observed pulmonary fibrosis of the worker.},

Four cases had persistent interstitial lung disease despite three having left the workplace. Two developed hypoxemic respiratory failure and secondary pulmonary hypertension and died of complications 18 and 20 years after diagnosis, respectively. Five cases resolved after leaving the workplace. Compared with resolved cases, persistent cases had lower diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide at presentation (P < .05) and follow-up (P < .05). Among exposed workers employed for 14.5 ± 4.7 years, five had abnormal chest radiographs vs none at baseline (P = .001) over 14.8 ± 4.6 years of follow-up. The prevalence of wheeze increased (P = .001), and FEV?/FVC decreased (P < .001). FEV?\% predicted was significantly lower at follow-up (P = .05). Average FEV? decline was 46 mL/year (range, -27 to 151 mL/y). Seventy-seven percent of exposed workers were current or former smokers.The natural history of FWL includes the following patterns: complete resolution of symptoms; radiographic and pulmonary function abnormalities; permanent, but stable symptoms and restrictive pulmonary function deficits; and progressive decline in pulmonary function, causing death from respiratory failure and secondary pulmonary hypertension. A low baseline diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide is associated with the persistence and progression of FWL.},

  abstract    = {In 2002 the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society (ATS/ERS) classification of idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IIPs) defined seven specific entities, and provided standardized terminology and diagnostic criteria. In addition, the historical "gold standard" of histologic diagnosis was replaced by a multidisciplinary approach. Since 2002 many publications have provided new information about IIPs.The objective of this statement is to update the 2002 ATS/ERS classification of IIPs.An international multidisciplinary panel was formed and developed key questions that were addressed through a review of the literature published between 2000 and 2011.Substantial progress has been made in IIPs since the previous classification. Nonspecific interstitial pneumonia is now better defined. Respiratory bronchiolitis-interstitial lung disease is now commonly diagnosed without surgical biopsy. The clinical course of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and nonspecific interstitial pneumonia is recognized to be heterogeneous. Acute exacerbation of IIPs is now well defined. A substantial percentage of patients with IIP are difficult to classify, often due to mixed patterns of lung injury. A classification based on observed disease behavior is proposed for patients who are difficult to classify or for entities with heterogeneity in clinical course. A group of rare entities, including pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis and rare histologic patterns, is introduced. The rapidly evolving field of molecular markers is reviewed with the intent of promoting additional investigations that may help in determining diagnosis, and potentially prognosis and treatment.This update is a supplement to the previous 2002 IIP classification document. It outlines advances in the past decade and potential areas for future investigation.},

In a meta-analysis of these studies, six exposures were significantly associated with IPF (summary odds ratios [95\% confidence intervals]), including ever smoking (1.58 [1.27-1.97]), agriculture/farming (1.65 [1.20-2.26]), livestock (2.17 [1.28-3.68]), wood dust (1.94 [1.34-2.81]), metal dust (2.44 [1.74-3.40]), and stone/sand (1.97 [1.09-3.55]). Although there are a number of limitations of the case-control design and these results alone do not establish a causal link, an assessment of all of the available evidence strongly suggests that IPF may be a heterogeneous disorder caused by a number of environmental and occupational exposures.},

Control hamsters were given vehicle of distilled water only. The hamsters were euthanized serially up to 78 wk after the final instillation and the toxicological effects were determined.Body weight gain was significantly suppressed in the ITO 6 mg/kg-treated hamsters compared with the control group, but not in the ITO 3 mg/kg-treated or In(2)O(3)-treated hamsters. Relative lung weights among all the indium-treated groups were significantly increased compared to that in the control group throughout the observation period. The serum indium concentration among all the indium-treated groups gradually increased up to the end of the observation period. Histopathologically, foci of slight to severe pulmonary inflammatory response with diffuse alveolar or bronchiolar cell hyperplasia, expansion of the alveolar spaces and interstitial fibrotic proliferation were present in all the indium-treated hamsters and the severity of these lesions worsened with the passage of time. Lung benign adenomas were only manifest in 3 out of 15 of the ITO 6 mg/kg-treated hamsters.The present results clearly demonstrate that ITO and In(2)O(3) particles caused chronic pulmonary toxicity when repeated intratracheal instillations were given to hamsters.},

The diagnosis derived from the finding, in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, of abnormal levels of La, Ce, Nd, Sm, Tb, Yb, and Lu. The presence of these elements was demonstrated by two methods: the neutron activation analysis and (as regards Ce alone) the X-ray energy spectrometry of mineral particles observed with electron microscope. Abnormal levels of rare earths were demonstrated also in the nails, suggesting an absorption of the RE from the lung.},

Animal studies and in vitro experiments show that nanoparticles can result in lung damage and other toxicity, but no reports on the clinical toxicity in humans due to nanoparticles have yet been made. The present study aimed to examine the relationship between a group of workers' presenting with mysterious symptomatic findings and their nanoparticle exposure. Seven young female workers (aged 18-47 yrs), exposed to nanoparticles for 5-13 months, all with shortness of breath and pleural effusions were admitted to hospital. Immunological tests, examinations of bacteriology, virology and tumour markers, bronchoscopy, internal thoracoscopy and video-assisted thoracic surgery were performed. Surveys of the workplace, clinical observations and examinations of the patients were conducted. Polyacrylate, consisting of nanoparticles, was confirmed in the workplace. Pathological examinations of patients' lung tissue displayed nonspecific pulmonary inflammation, pulmonary fibrosis and foreign-body granulomas of pleura. Using transmission electron microscopy, nanoparticles were observed to lodge in the cytoplasm and caryoplasm of pulmonary epithelial and mesothelial cells, but are also located in the chest fluid. These cases arouse concern that long-term exposure to some nanoparticles without protective measures may be related to serious damage to human lungs.},

Survivors were offered a follow-up evaluation.Morbidity and mortality related to AEP.There were 18 cases of AEP identified among 183,000 military personnel deployed in or near Iraq during the study period, yielding an AEP incidence of 9.1 per 100,000 person-years (95\% confidence interval, 4.3-13.3). The majority of patients (89\%) were men and the median age was 22 (range, 19-47) years. All patients used tobacco, with 78\% recently beginning to smoke. All but 1 reported significant exposure to fine airborne sand or dust. Known causes of pulmonary eosinophilia (eg, drug exposures or parasitic disease) were not identified. Epidemiologic investigation revealed no evidence of a common source exposure, temporal or geographic clustering, person-to-person transmission, or an association with recent vaccination. Six patients underwent bronchoalveolar lavage (median eosinophilia of 40.5\%). All patients developed peripheral eosinophilia (range, 8\%-42\%). Mechanical ventilation was required in 67\% for a median of 7 (range, 2-16) days. Two soldiers died; the remainder responded to corticosteroids and/or supportive care. Twelve individuals were reevaluated a median of 3 months after diagnosis. At that point, 3 patients reported mild dyspnea and 1 reported wheezing. All patients had finished treatment and had either normal or nearly normal spirometry results. None had recurrent eosinophilia.AEP occurred at an increased rate among this deployed military population and resulted in 2 deaths. Failure to consider AEP in the differential diagnosis of respiratory failure in military personnel can result in missing this syndrome and possibly death. The etiology of AEP remains unclear, but the association with new-onset smoking suggests a possible link.},

A man working in a lithographic laboratory as a photoengraver, and exposed to the smoke of cored carbon arc lamps over a period of 46 years developed an interstitial pneumoconiosis. Neutron activation analysis (NAA) of eight rare-earths (La, Ce, Nd, Sm, Eu, Tb, Yb and Lu) in lung and lymph node biopsies showed an abnormally high amount of these elements in comparison to the corresponding values of 11 autopsied for unexposed subjects. The estimated radiological dose due to the inhalation of natural thorium, as calculated from NAA of thorium in the biopsies, tends to exclude the effect of ionizing radiation in the pathogenesis of lung fibrosis. Effects of other potential pathogenetic agents such as coal or heavy metal dusts, other than RE, irritative agents such as nitrous and hydrofluoric vapours originated during the photoengraving process, are also discussed. The findings strongly suggest that a relationship exists between the pneumoconiosis diagnosed and the occupational exposure to rare-earth dusts calling attention to proposals for maximum permissible concentration limits of occupational exposure to RE in air.},

  abstract    = {To determine the rate of chest radiographic abnormalities among residents of North Dakota potentially exposed to road gravel containing the fibrous mineral erionite.Participants (n = 34) completed a questionnaire, chest radiograph, and high resolution computed tomography scan to assess the rate of interstitial and pleural changes consistent with fibrous mineral exposure.Interstitial, pleural, or both changes typically associated with asbestos exposure were observed by high resolution computed tomography in seven (21\%) individuals. The primary exposure pathway for six of these was from gravel pits, road maintenance, or both. Three participants (8.8\%) demonstrated bilateral localized pleural changes with calcification; two of these also had accompanying interstitial changes. All three reported extensive work in gravel pits, road maintenance, or both.These results indicate that occupational exposure to erionite contained within road gravel in the United States represents a potential health hazard.This study identifies chest radiographic changes among residents of North Dakota occupationally exposed to road gravel containing erionite. Public health officials and physicians in affected areas should be aware of the potential health effects of erionite exposure. Precautionary measures should be taken to limit occupational exposure to gravel containing erionite.},

A model of causation that describes causes in terms of sufficient causes and their component causes illuminates important principles such as multi-causality, the dependence of the strength of component causes on the prevalence of complementary component causes, and interaction between component causes. Philosophers agree that causal propositions cannot be proved, and find flaws or practical limitations in all philosophies of causal inference. Hence, the role of logic, belief, and observation in evaluating causal propositions is not settled. Causal inference in epidemiology is better viewed as an exercise in measurement of an effect rather than as a criterion-guided process for deciding whether an effect is present or not.},

The firefighter presented with a Pa(O2) of 53 mm Hg and responded to oxygen and corticosteroids. Computed tomography scan showed patchy ground glass density, thickened bronchial walls, and bilateral pleural effusions. Bronchoalveolar lavage recovered 70\% eosinophils, with only 1\% eosinophils in peripheral blood. Eosinophils were not degranulated and increased levels of interleukin-5 were measured in bronchoalveolar lavage and serum. Mineralogic analysis counted 305 commercial asbestos fibers/10(6) macrophages including those with high aspect ratios, and significant quantities of fly ash and degraded fibrous glass. Acute eosinophilic pneumonia is a rare consequence of acute high dust exposure. World Trade Center dust consists of large particle-size silicates, but fly ash and asbestos fibers may be found in bronchoalveolar lavage cells.},

Histologic studies of open-lung biopsy showed a lipoid pneumonia characterized by (1) alveolitis involving large lipid-laden macrophages and (2) interstitial fibrosis. Electron microscopy of AMs disclosed features of paraffin-laden cytoplasmic vacuoles. Successive treatments included prednisolone and cyclophosphamide. Despite these treatments and withdrawal from exposure, the pulmonary function became impaired progressively, resulting in restrictive syndrome and severe exertional dyspnea. Concomitantly, PMNs harvested by BAL increased, whereas initial lymphocytosis decreased. This is the first case observed of occupational interstitial fibrosis in which electron-microscopic findings clearly established a relationship with an exposure to paraffin. This observation also emphasizes the switch from alveolitis to fibrosis in the pathogenesis of interstitial pulmonary disease.},

Chest X-ray films and pulmonary function tests showed an interstitial lung disease, emphysema and a severe obstructive impairment with marked decrease of carbon monoxide diffusion capacity. The histological examination of a transbronchial biopsy confirmed the diffuse interstitial lung fibrosis. Neutron activation analysis (NAA) of the biopsy showed concentrations of cerium (Ce), lanthanum (La), neodimium (Nd), samarium (Sm), terbium (Tb) and ytterbium (Yb) which were high compared to the corresponding elements in the transbronchial biopsies of 5 unexposed subjects as a control group. Thorium (Th) (which is generally present as an impurity of the RE compounds) was also determined in order to estimate the radiation dose in the lung of the worker. On the basis of the clinical observations, of the analytical results by neutron activation analysis of RE and of the presence of Th in the transbronchial biopsy, as well as of the differential diagnosis, which tended to exclude other occupational or non-occupational lung diseases, a relation between the observed interstitial lung fibrosis and occupational exposure to RE is highly probable.},

We identified 84,010 IPF deaths, with an age-adjusted mortality rate of 75.7 deaths/million. Mortality rates were highest among males, whites, and those aged 85 and older. Three industry categories with potential occupational exposures recognized as risk factors for IPF were identified: "Wood buildings and mobile homes" (PMR = 4.5, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.2-11.6 and MOR = 5.3, 95\% CI 1.2-23.8), "Metal mining" (PMR = 2.4, 95\% CI 1.3-4.0 and MOR = 2.2, 95\% CI 1.1-4.4), and "Fabricated structural metal products" (PMR = 1.9, 95\% CI 1.1-3.1 and MOR = 1.7, 95\% CI 1.0-3.1).

We conducted a multicenter retrospective study to characterize this rare clinical entity further and to improve its diagnostic criteria. A total of 13 male and 9 female patients (mean age: 29 +/- 15.8 years) presented with severe hypoxemia (Pa(O2)/fraction of inspired oxygen ratio = 156 +/- 74.1) requiring mechanical ventilation in 14 cases. Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed on all patients and showed 54.4 +/- 19.2\% eosinophils on differential cell count, but no open-lung biopsies were done. No clinical differences were found between patients seen at less than 7 days (n = 15) or at 7 to 31 days (n = 7) from the onset of IAEP. A total of 12 patients met the clinical criteria of acute lung injury, and eight of these patients met the criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome. All patients recovered, either spontaneously (6) or on corticosteroid treatment (16). No relapses occurred. We conclude that: (1) diagnostic criteria of IAEP are compatible with a duration of symptoms for up to 1 month, but the response to corticosteroid treatment is not diagnostic because of possible spontaneous recovery; (2) IAEP should be considered as differential diagnosis of acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome; (3) bronchoalveolar lavage eosinophilia obviates the need for lung biopsy in IAEP.},

  abstract    = {We are all living in the era of globalization and, like it or not, it is going to change the way we practise epidemiology, the kinds of questions we ask and the methods we use to answer them. However, the methods, and ways of thinking about the health of populations, that will be required for epidemiology in the 21st century are in some instances quite different from the standard epidemiological techniques that are taught in most textbooks and courses today. As we develop epidemiological methods for addressing the scientific and public health problems of the 21st century, it is important that we consider, once again, the distinction between the analysis of variance and the analysis of causes. This has primarily been considered with respect to genetic research, and also with regard to the problems of making comparisons between different populations and environments at the same point in time. It has not been considered in depth with regard to the issues of conducting epidemiological research in a world that is changing over time. In this article, I first consider the statistical and scientific issues involved in the distinction between the analysis of variance and the analysis of causes. I then discuss some examples of the implications of this distinction for the theory and practice of epidemiology in a changing world, particularly with regard to risk factors that become ubiquitous over time. Sometimes the most important causes of disease are invisible because they are everywhere.},

No significant retention of asbestos was demonstrated in lung tissue by light microscopy (asbestos bodies) or transmission electron microscopy analysis (uncoated fibers). Particles containing rare earth (cerium, lanthanum) and phosphorus were identified in alveolar macrophages in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and cerium-containing particles accounted for 70\% of particles observed in the lung tissue. Ultrastructural analysis of lung tissue revealed the presence of particles containing cerium and phosphorus in interstitial macrophages and elastic fibers. These results suggest that rare earth is metabolized and should be considered as biopersistent in the human respiratory tract, since occupational inquiries revealed that exposure to cerium oxide abrasive powder had ceased at least 15 years earlier.},

Study of the distribution of mineralogical species in human samples showed that particles containing cerium were encountered in less than 10\% of subjects. The proportion of subjects with particles containing cerium in their biological samples was not different between controls and subjects with previous occupational exposure to fibrous or nonfibrous mineral dusts. This was considered as the background level of lung retention of cerium in the general population. By contrast, determination of the absolute concentration of particles containing cerium in BAL fluid and lung tissue samples showed that 1.2\% (from BAL fluid) and 1.5\% (from lung tissue) of subjects with previous exposure to mineral particles had high lung retention of particles containing cerium.

All cases and epidemiological studies in Japan indicate that exposure to hardly soluble indium compounds causes interstitial as well as emphysematous lung damages, which we call "Indium Lung". Based on the epidemiological studies, the Japan Society for Occupational Health proposed 3 ?g/l of indium in serum as an occupational exposure limit based on biological monitoring to prevent significant increase of KL-6.Long-term follow-up of currently and formerly indium-exposed workers is essential not only to clarify the natural history of indium lung but also to trace the incidence of lung cancer. It is also necessary to elucidate the mechanism of indium lung and difference in clinical manifestations between Japanese and US cases.},

  abstract    = {There have been few systematic studies of the non-malignant health effects of alpha-particle radiation in humans. Animal studies and a report on plutonium-exposed workers from Russia suggest an association between high doses to the lung from plutonium exposure and the development of fibrotic lung disease. Prompted by a case of lung fibrosis in a retired plutonium worker, we tested the hypothesis that plutonium inhalation increases the risk for developing chest radiograph abnormalities consistent with pulmonary fibrosis. We conducted a retrospective study of nuclear weapons workers that included estimating absorbed doses to the lung with an internal dosimetry model. Our study population consisted of 326 plutonium-exposed workers with absorbed lung doses from 0 to 28 Sv and 194 unexposed workers. We compared the severity of chest radiograph interstitial abnormalities between the two groups using the International Labour Organization profusion scoring system. There was a significantly higher proportion of abnormal profusion scores among plutonium-exposed workers (17.5\%) than among unexposed workers (7.2\%), P < 0.01. Lung doses of 10 Sv or greater conferred a 5.3-fold risk (95\% CI 1.2-23.4) of having an abnormal chest X ray consistent with pulmonary fibrosis when compared with unexposed individuals after controlling for the effects of age, smoking and asbestos exposure. This study shows that plutonium may cause lung fibrosis in humans at absorbed lung doses above 10 Sv.},

Three patients with anthracofibrosis without mycobacterial infection are described who had previous occupational exposure to mixed dusts. CT scans showed calcified hilar lymph nodes in two patients. Surgical biopsy in one patient and autopsy in another revealed fibrotic lymph nodes with black pigmentation. Mineralogical analysis by transmission electron microscopy of pulmonary, hilar and/or bronchial samples found high levels of particle retention, raised percentages of free crystalline silica and mica in two patients, and free crystalline silica, kaolin and other silicates in the third. No evidence of any other contributory factor was found, suggesting that mixed mineral dust was the most probable cause. These observations suggest that exposure to mixed mineral dust should be added to the aetiology of anthracofibrosis.},

Two rounds of a questionnaire were mailed; 17 cases (37.7\%) and 94 controls (32.4\%) responded to the questionnaire, although many of the case addresses were no longer valid. Individuals with ILD were 16.0 times as likely to report mold exposure and 11.1 times as likely to report silica as were controls in their workplace. Odds ratios associating ILD with moisture indicators in the home were in the same range as previously published associations between such indicators and wheezing.

Clinical and radiological data together with biopsy specimens from 71 (27.6\%) workers with abnormal respiratory features indicated the occurrence of an outbreak of organising pneumonia resulting in 6 deaths. Epidemiological analysis included the 22 workers who fulfilled the radiological case definition based on chest radiograph and computed tomographic scan showing widespread nodular opacities or confluent patchy consolidation with a lung biopsy corresponding to organising pneumonia. The overall attack rate was 8.9\%. Only 2 of the 22 cases never worked in factories A or B. Those who had only worked in factory A had the highest risk of being a case (RR = 24.3; 95\% CI = 5.7-104.4). The relationship of case status to period of employment suggested an abrupt change in exposure conditions in the period when Acramin FWR was substituted by Acramin FWN. Although the precise toxicological mechanism is unknown, it is proposed that the lung disease was caused by spraying procedures delivered a respirable aerosol of Acramin FWN to distal airways and pulmonary parenchyma.},

  abstract    = {The clinical features of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis can be indistinguishable; the need to eliminate occult environmental factors known to cause pulmonary fibrosis in patients suspected to have IPF during diagnostic evaluation is evident. We aimed to investigate occult, putative causes in the environments of patients diagnosed with IPF using tests beyond those conventionally used.In this case-cohort study, 60 consecutive patients diagnosed with IPF on the basis of the 2000 American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the European Respiratory Society (ERS) criteria were prospectively followed up every 4 months for 6 years between Jan 1, 2004, and Dec 31, 2009. At each visit a uniformly applied questionnaire was administered to these 60 patients to identify occult antigen exposure known to cause hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Patients underwent specific IgG determination, bronchoalveolar lavage, bronchial challenge testing with suspected antigens, and re-review of histopathological features in existing and subsequently obtained surgical lung biopsy samples and from lung explants. Specimens obtained from suspected sources from the patient's environment were subjected to cultures in microbiology laboratory. These clinical data and discussions among pulmonologists and radiologists familiar with IPF were used to confirm the diagnosis in accordance with 2011 ATS, ERS, Japanese Respiratory Society, and Latin American Thoracic Association guidelines; 46 of the 60 patients had IPF according to the 2011 guidelines, and our analyses in this study were focused on these 46 patients.20 of the 46 (43\%, 95\% CI 29-58) patients with IPF according to 2011 guidelines had a subsequent diagnosis of chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis: nine patients had positive bronchial challenge testing (eight of whom were also IgG positive and six of these patients also had surgical lung biopsy showing a pattern consistent with chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis); seven were IgG positive plus had histopathology on surgical lung biopsy that was consistent with hypersensitivity pneumonitis; one was IgG positive plus had greater than 20\% lymphocytes in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid; and three had findings on surgical lung biopsy that were consistent with subacute hypersensitivity pneumonitis (and IgG positive). Altogether, 29 of 46 patients diagnosed with IPF who had met the 2011 criteria had lung tissue available for histopathology (surgical lung biopsy in 28 patients and explanted lung in two patients, one of whom also had surgical biopsy) during the study period, and 16 of the 20 patients with chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis had histopathological features on surgical lung biopsy that were consistent with this diagnosis. 26 of the 46 patients remained with a diagnosis of IPF.Almost half of patients diagnosed with IPF on the basis of 2011 criteria were subsequently diagnosed with chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and most of these cases were attributed to exposure of occult avian antigens from commonly used feather bedding. Our results reflect findings in one centre with recognised expertise in chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and further research and studies at other centres are warranted.Fondo de Investigaciones Sanitarias; Fundació Privada Cellex; SEPAR 2010.},

  abstract    = {Respiratory bronchiolitis-associated interstitial lung disease (RBILD) is a rare form of interstitial lung disease which may present in similar fashion to other types of chronic interstitial pneumonia. The purpose of this study was to undertake a clinicopathological review of 10 patients with RBILD and to examine the clinical and imaging data related to its histopathological pattern, in particular the relationship of RBILD to smoking.Thirteen out of 168 retrospectively reviewed patients, from whom biopsy specimens were taken for suspected diffuse lung disease, were identified with a histopathological pattern of RBILD. Three cases were rejected as follow up data were unavailable. The 10 remaining cases constituted the study group and both clinical and imaging data were collected from patients' notes and referring physicians.Histopathologically, four cases of RBILD overlapped with the pattern of desquamative interstitial pneumonitis (DIP) and nine also had microscopic evidence of centrilobular emphysema. Nine patients were smokers, ranging from 3 to 80 pack years. The one non-smoker had an occupational exposure to the fumes of solder flux. The sex distribution was equal with an age range of 32-65 years. Two patients were clubbed. Lung function tests showed both restrictive and obstructive patterns together with severe reductions in carbon monoxide transfer factor in seven patients. Chest radiographs showed reticular or reticulonodular infiltrates in five patients and a ground glass pattern in two. CT scans were consistent with either DIP or RBILD in six of eight patients. Although seven patients remained stable or improved, either with or without treatment, three patients deteriorated.This study adds weight to the hypothesis that smoking can cause clinically significant interstitial lung disease, with deterioration in pulmonary function despite treatment. Given the overlapping histopathological patterns of RBILD and DIP and their strong association with smoking, the term "smoking related interstitial lung disease" is suggested for those patients who are smokers.},

  abstract    = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive fibrosing interstitial lung disease of unknown etiology. Environmental factors, especially occupational agents, may be of great importance in the manifestation of IPF. We examined the relationship between occupational and environmental factors and IPF in Japan. A multicenter hospital-based case-control study was performed in 2001. Included were 102 cases aged 40 years or over who were within 2 years of having been diagnosed in accordance with the most recent criteria. Controls, aged 40 years or over, were 55 hospitalized patients diagnosed as having acute bacterial pneumonia and four outpatients with common colds. Data on occupational and environmental factors were obtained from a questionnaire. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) of IPF for single factors with adjustment for age, sex and region. Compared with controls, cases were more likely to have been managers, officials or production workers and less likely to have been protective service or materials handling workers. Clerical and related work was significantly related to a decreased risk of IPF after further adjustment for pack-years of smoking (OR = 0.42; 95\% CI = 0.18-0.95). Exposure to metal dust was significantly associated with an increased risk of IPF (OR = 9.55; 95\% CI = 1.68-181.12). From 20.0 to 39.9 pack-years of smoking was significantly associated with an increased risk of IPF (OR = 3.23; 95\% CI = 1.01-10.84). Our results appear to confirm data from previous epidemiologic studies. Metal dust exposure may be a particularly important risk factor for IPF.},

The clinical picture ranged from minor symptoms to manifestations resembling those of hypersensitivity pneumonitis, with fever, weight-loss, non-productive cough and dyspnea. A restrictive impairment of the ventilatory function was prevalent. The chest roentgenogram of one patient showed a diffuse reticular nodular pattern, while the others presented a mild reticular accentuation of the interstitium. In five patients, bioptic specimens of the lung parenchyma showed interstitial collagenic fibrosis with inflammatory cells infiltrating the alveolar septa. An increased number of lymphocytes and polymorphs was reported in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid from seven patients. Giant multinucleated cells were present in the BAL of four subjects while an inversion of the helper-suppressor ratio was evident in those patients who were still exposed to cobalt when BAL was performed. In this study, the causal role of metallic cobalt inhalation in the etiology of the lung disease is examined and discussed.},

Temporal trends in SMRs were also examined. Proportional mortality ratios (PMRs) were calculated using the Southampton (based on the 1980 standard occupational classification) coding scheme. Temporal trends in PMRs were also examined.The annual number of mesothelioma deaths has increased from 153 in 1968 to 1848 in 2001. Current deaths in males account for about 85\% of the cases. The areas of West Dunbartonshire (SMR 637), Barrow-in-Furness (593), Plymouth (396) and Portsmouth (388) have the highest SMRs over the period 1981-2000. The occupations with the highest PMRs are metal plate workers (PMR 503), vehicle body builders (526), plumbers and gas fitters (413) and carpenters (388).These data reinforce earlier findings that geographical areas and occupations associated with high exposure to asbestos in the past continue to drive the mesothelioma epidemic in Great Britain. However, the trends over time suggest a change in the balance of risk away from traditional asbestos exposure industries to industries where one could describe the exposure as secondary, such as plumbers and gas fitters, carpenters, and electricians.},

The patient presented with progressive dyspnea and an interstitial pattern on chest X-ray; open lung biopsy showed interstitial fibrosis histologically indistinguishable from usual interstitial pneumonitis. However, scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray analysis demonstrated numerous particulate deposits in the lung, of which the majority contained the rare earth metal cerium alone or in combination with other elements. Our case is one of the first to describe rare earth pneumoconiosis associated with pulmonary fibrosis in the occupational setting of optical lens manufacture. Besides reinforcing the contention that rare earth metals are potentially harmful, our case suggests that such agents may be causally related to the development of pulmonary fibrosis.},

  abstract    = {Cerium compounds have been used as a diesel engine catalyst to lower the mass of diesel exhaust particles, but are emitted as cerium oxide (CeO(2)) nanoparticles in the diesel exhaust. In a previous study, we have demonstrated a wide range of CeO(2)-induced lung responses including sustained pulmonary inflammation and cellular signaling that could lead to pulmonary fibrosis. In this study, we investigated the fibrogenic responses induced by CeO(2) in a rat model at various time points up to 84 days post-exposure. Male Sprague Dawley rats were exposed to CeO(2) by a single intratracheal instillation. Alveolar macrophages (AM) were isolated by bronchial alveolar lavage (BAL). AM-mediated cellular responses, osteopontin (OPN) and transform growth factor (TGF)-?1 in the fibrotic process were investigated. The results showed that CeO(2) exposure significantly increased fibrotic cytokine TGF-?1 and OPN production by AM above controls. The collagen degradation enzymes, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and -9 and the tissue inhibitor of MMP were markedly increased in the BAL fluid at 1 day- and subsequently declined at 28 days after exposure, but remained much higher than the controls. CeO(2) induced elevated phospholipids in BAL fluid and increased hydroxyproline content in lung tissue in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Immunohistochemical analysis showed MMP-2, MMP-9 and MMP-10 expressions in fibrotic regions. Morphological analysis noted increased collagen fibers in the lungs exposed to a single dose of 3.5mg/kg CeO(2) and euthanized at 28 days post-exposure. Collectively, our studies show that CeO(2) induced fibrotic lung injury in rats, suggesting it may cause potential health effects.},

Nevertheless, it is still possible to diagnose new cases, perhaps in relatively unusual working activities.To describe a case of q 2/2 pneumoconiosis associated with mixed powder containing less than 1\% quartz that occurred in a 37 year-old female worker, who had been previously employed (1987-1994) in manually spraying a primer solution on the bottom of non-stick aluminium pans.The manufacturing firm supplied details of the composition of the primer. The physiological, pathological and occupational history was obtained for the worker, who also underwent: respiratory functional exploration, chest radiographs and HRCT of the thorax, fibrobronchoscopy, with transbronchial biopsy and BAL collection. The lung tissue sample was examined via light microscopy and scanning electron microscope analysis.The primer contained 6.8\% talc, free from asbestos or silica, 3.8\% iron oxides and 0.6\% bentonite which, in turn, contained less than 1\% crystalline silica. The job was performed in a semi-confined environment, with an inefficient aspiration system. The worker had never complained of respiratory symptoms. Radiographs and HRCT showed widespread micronodulation. Light microscopy of pulmonary tissue showed multinucleate giant cell granulomas with intracytoplasmatic inclusions. Scanning electron microscope analysis revealed that these consisted of agglomerated particles, microanalysis of which showed the presence of a silicate.Particular jobs performed up to few years ago in Italy in a semi-confined environment can still involve exposure to doses of mineral dusts such as to cause pneumoconiosis. This is the first case of mixed powder pneumoconiosis described in a worker employed in the production of non-stick aluminium pans.},

  abstract    = {Indium-Tin-Oxide (ITO) is a sintered mixture of indium- (In(2)O(3)) and tin-oxide (SnO(2)) in a ratio of 90:10 (wt:wt) that is used for the manufacture of LCD screens and related high technology applications. Interstitial pulmonary diseases have recently been reported in workers from ITO producing plants. The present study was conducted to identify experimentally the exact chemical component responsible for this toxicity and to address possible mechanisms of action. The reactivity of respirable ITO particles was compared with that of its single components alone or their unsintered 90:10 mixture (MIX) both in vivo and in vitro. For all endpoints considered, ITO particles behaved as a specific toxic entity. In vivo, after a single pharyngeal administration (2-20 mg per rat), ITO particles induced a strong inflammatory reaction. At day 3, the inflammatory reaction (cell accumulation, LDH and protein in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid) appeared more marked with ITO particles than with each oxide separately or the MIX. This inflammatory reaction persisted and even worsened after 15 days. After 60 days, this inflammation was still present but no significant fibrotic response was observed. The cytotoxicity of ITO was assessed in vitro in lung epithelial cells (RLE) and macrophages (NR8383 cell line). While ITO particles (up to 200 microg/ml) did not affect epithelial cell integrity (LDH release), a strong cytotoxic response was found in macrophages exposed to ITO, but not to its components alone or mixed. ITO particles also induced an increased frequency of micronuclei in type II pneumocytes in vivo but not in RLE in vitro, suggesting the preponderance of a secondary genotoxic mechanism. To address the possible mechanism of ITO toxicity, reactive oxygen species production was assessed by electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometry in an acellular system. Carbon centered radicals (COO-.) and Fenton-like activity were detected in the presence of ITO particles, not with In(2)O(3), SnO(2) alone, or the MIX. Because the unsintered mixture of SnO(2) and In(2)O(3) particles was unable to reproduce the reactivity/toxicity of ITO particles, the sintering process through which SnO(2) molecules are introduced within the crystal structure of In(2)O(3) appears critical to explain the unique toxicological properties of ITO. The inflammatory and genotoxic activities of ITO dust indicate that a strict control of exposure is needed in industrial settings.},

The patient worked in a pharmacy and crushed clozapine tablets over several years. She presented with insidious onset of breathlessness and had mild hypoxia. High-resolution computed tomography demonstrated centrilobular nodules with peribronchial consolidation. Lung biopsy revealed a mixed cellular and fibrotic NSIP. Her symptoms and radiological findings resolved once exposure to clozapine powder ceased. The clear temporal relationship between increased exposure to inhaled clozapine and the development of NSIP, followed by the subsequent resolution on cessation of exposure, strongly suggest an occupational cause. Both the active ingredients and the excipients of powdered medicine may be responsible for causing pneumonitis in chronic exposure.},

  abstract    = {Pneumoconiosis induced by non-crystalline silica is considered rare, although silicosis resulting from contact with crystalline silica is a well-known hazard associated with progressive pulmonary fibrosis. Here we describe a patient with pneumoconiosis induced by diatomaceous earth composed of amorphous silica detected by two-dimensional imaging of chemical elements. The histology revealed that the disease was characterized by a granulomatous reaction in the lung. A large number of macrophages laden with yellow and black pigments accumulated in alveolar spaces and were incorporated into the interstitial sites. Bronchiolar walls were destroyed by palisade macrophages, suggesting airflow obstruction. Packed macrophages adhering to and covering the denuded interstitium indicated that macrophages might be incorporated into pulmonary interstitium in this fashion. Immunohistochemistry showed that cyclooxygenase-2, an antifibrogenic mediator, was intensely expressed in the macrophages compared with macrophages in control lungs. No birefringent material was found in the tissues. When two-dimensional analysis of chemical elements was performed using an electron probe microanalyzer with a wavelength-dispersive spectrometer, the resultant fine mapping of silicon and oxygen on the tissue indicated that the pigments phagocytosed by macrophages corresponded to amorphous silica. In conclusion, two-dimensional analysis of elements is very useful for pathologists in correlating the presence of chemical elements with histological changes.},

Quartz accounted for 70\% of the amount of all mineral dust in both patients, but pyrophyllite accounted for 10.8\% and 14.4\%. The pulmonary mineral dust composition in the two patients was well consistent with the mineral composition of the raw clays in the agalmatolite mine.

The clinical features, associated diseases, and clinical outcomes were investigated through the analysis of medical records.There were 51 males (15.3\%) and 282 females (84.7\%), having a mean age of 72.3 years, ranging from 47 to 90. 33\% of patients had a past history of pulmonary tuberculosis. Dyspnea (38.4\%) and cough (29.8\%) were most common presenting symptoms, followed by hemoptysis (8.9\%). Baseline pulmonary function showed mild airflow obstruction. Among patients with forced expiratory volume in 1s (FEV(1))/forced vital capacity (FVC)<0.7, Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) stages I and II were most common. Associated diseases were active tuberculosis in 33.9\% of patients, pneumonia in 29.5\%, acute exacerbation of chronic airways disease in 22.5\%, and malignancy in 4.8\%. Among the 18 patients who died at a hospital during the follow-up period, acute infection and malignancy were common causes of death.These findings suggest that biomass smoke induced BAF usually appears clinically as a form of obstructive airways disease. Since various pulmonary diseases, including tuberculosis, pneumonia, and malignancy, can be associated with BAF, thorough clinical evaluation and close follow-up of these patients are required.},

Although a spectrum of cytologic and histopathologic abnormalities has been observed, nonspecific interstitial pneumonia, lymphoid nodules, and lymphocytic bronchiolitis predominated in the 19 previously reported cases of flock worker's lung. Here we describe five additional patients who appear to expand the histopathologic spectrum and add to the evidence suggesting a causative role for respirable-sized nylon fragments.We studied all North American patients (n = 5) found in 1998 to satisfy our previous case definition of flock worker's lung. Two pulmonary pathologists independently reviewed each biopsy specimen.All five patients reported cough and dyspnea. Only one patient had crackles on chest auscultation. High-resolution CT scan, interpreted with attention to subtle ground-glass attenuation, remained a highly sensitive diagnostic test. Pulmonary function tests and plain chest radiograph were less sensitive. One patient's wedge biopsy showed previously described prototypical findings. Two others had transbronchial biopsies showing some of the same features. The fourth patient's wedge biopsy showed desquamative interstitial pneumonia. The fifth patient had bilateral synchronous adenocarcinoma but with radiographic evidence of diffuse interstitial fibrosis. These 5 patients and the 19 patients studied previously were exposed to nylon flock manufactured by a rarely used cutting technology.Findings in these five patients appear to broaden the spectrum of the clinicopathology of flock worker's lung and add to the evidence incriminating respirable-sized nylon particulates produced during the manufacture and use of rotary-cut nylon flock.},

Similar clusters at the same company's Canadian plant were reported previously.To define the extent, clinicopathologic features, and potential causes of the apparent disease outbreak.Case-finding survey and retrospective cohort study.Academic occupational medicine program.All workers employed at the Rhode Island plant on or after 15 June 1990.Symptomatic employees had chest radiography, pulmonary function tests, high-resolution computed tomography, and serologic testing. Those with unexplained radiographic or pulmonary function abnormalities underwent bronchoalveolar lavage, lung biopsy, or both. The case definition of "flock worker's lung" required histologic evidence of interstitial lung disease (or lavage evidence of lung inflammation) not explained by another condition.Eight cases of flock worker's lung were identified at the Rhode Island plant. Three cases were characterized by a high proportion of eosinophils (25\% to 40\%) in lavage fluid. Six of the seven patients who had biopsy had histologic findings of nonspecific interstitial pneumonia, and the seventh had bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia. All seven of these patients had peribronchovascular interstitial lymphoid nodules, usually with germinal centers, and most had lymphocytic bronchiolitis and interstitial fibrosis. All improved after leaving work. Review of the Canadian tissue specimens showed many similar histologic findings. Among the 165-member study cohort, a 48-fold or greater increase was seen in the sex-adjusted incidence rate of all interstitial lung disease.Work in the nylon flocking industry poses substantial risk for a previously unrecognized occupational interstitial lung disease. Nylon fiber is the suspected cause of this condition.},

  abstract    = {In recent years the greatest progress in our understanding of pneumoconioses, other than those produced by asbestos, silica, and coal, has been in the arena of metal-induced parenchymal lung disorders. Inhalation of metal dusts and fumes can induce a wide range of lung pathology, including airways disorders, cancer, and parenchymal diseases. The emphasis of this update is on parenchymal diseases caused by metal inhalation, including granulomatous disease, giant cell interstitial pneumonitis, chemical pneumonitis, and interstitial fibrosis, among others. The clinical characteristics, epidemiology, and pathogenesis of disorders arising from exposure to aluminum, beryllium, cadmium, cobalt, copper, iron, mercury, and nickel are presented in detail. Metal fume fever, an inhalation fever syndrome attributed to exposure to a number of metals, is also discussed. Advances in our knowledge of antigen-specific immunologic reactions in the lung are particularly evident in disorders secondary to beryllium and nickel exposure, where immunologic mechanisms have been well characterized. For example, current evidence suggests that beryllium acts as an antigen, or hapten, and is presented by antigen-presenting cells to CD4+ T cells, which possess specific surface antigen receptors. Other metals such as cadmium and mercury induce nonspecific damage, probably by initiating production of reactive oxygen species. Additionally, genetic susceptibility markers associated with increased risk have been identified in some metal-related diseases such as chronic beryllium disease and hard metal disease. Future research needs include development of biologic markers of metal-induced immunologic disease, detailed characterization of human exposure, examination of gene alleles that might confer risk, and association of exposure data with that of genetic susceptibility.},

Age and sex distribution of the subjects revealed a high peak in their seventh decade with males predominating. The IPF rate was more than two times higher (p < 0.01) among subjects engaged in occupations that exposed them to dust or organic solvents compared with those in other jobs. To ascertain job characteristics, an autopsy-case control study was conducted using other annual volumes of the autopsy data records and a similar tendency was observed. Then, a live-case control study was undertaken of 86 subjects with IPF. A significantly higher odds ratio was noted among metal production workers and miners compared with healthy and hospital control subjects (1.37 and 1.34, respectively, p < 0.01), and also a significantly lower odds ratio among subjects who frequently eat fish. Taken together with results of recent in vitro studies, the intrapulmonary deposition of hazardous dusts, especially metallic dusts, appears to play at least a partial role in initiating IPF.},

The disease was found in a high frequency in high age groups, especially in males, and was more prevalent in agricultural than in urbanized districts of Japan. Studies on the occupational distribution demonstrated a significantly higher rate of the disease in the occupations in which workers might have been exposed to harmful dusts or fumes. Other studies on autopsy cases also reported a high incidence of IIP in occupationally exposed groups, and a clinical case control study again reported a high incidence of IIP in the occupational group including production metal workers. Together with the previous studies on element analysis of IIP tissue, exposure to harmful dusts including metallic compounds is a possible trigger, at least partly, for idiopathic interstitial pneumonia.},

  abstract    = {Cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis (CFA), synonymous with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, is probably a disease entity of increasing frequency. Epidemiological investigations into the aetiology of CFA are at an early age; yet there are several indications that exposures associated with traditionally male manufacturing occupations may be a cause of CFA. Specifically, metal exposure, and to a lesser extent wood dust exposure, was increased in patients with CFA and may explain some cases of CFA. Indeed, the four case-control studies in the literature, to date, have all found an identical occupational exposure to metal or working with metal as a risk factor for CFA and there is now further evidence confirming this association from a case-control study nested within an occupational cohort. There is also evidence from three of the case-control studies that working with wood may be a risk factor for CFA. However, these exposures clearly only explain a minority of cases of cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis. Further studies amongst different populations with different occupational demographics are required to fully assess the impact of several exposures on the occurrence of cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis.},

In this study, to clarify the pathological findings of these two subtypes, 60 IIP patients in whom open lung biopsy and/or autopsy were performed were studied both clinically and pathologically. The following results were obtained. 1) Pathological features of type-A were alveolitis, marked restriction of the lung secondary to atelectasis and fibrosis of lung parenchyma, and honeycombing as a result of remodeling. 2) The features of type-B were intra-alveolar organization and secondary emphysema after intra-alveolar inflammation (pneumonia) overlapped the pathological changes of type-A. 3) Patients with a history of dust inhalation were much more frequently observed in type-B than in type-A (p < 0.01).

This study shows that, as in in vivo studies, the three polycationic paint components, Acramin FWR (a polyurea), Acramin FWN (a polyamide-amine), and Acrafix FHN (a polyamine) exhibited considerable cytotoxicity (LC50 generally below 100 microg/ml for an incubation of 20-24 h) in vitro, while Acramoll W, which is not a polycation, was almost non-toxic (in the concentration range tested). The cytotoxicity was comparable in primary cultures of rat and human type II pneumocytes and alveolar macrophages as well as in the pulmonary cell line A549 and the hepatic cell line HepG2. In human erythrocytes, the toxicity was less pronounced. We speculate that the multiple positive charges play an important role in the toxic mechanism. It is concluded that Acramin FWR and Acramin FWN have similar intrinsic toxicity and that these polymeric compounds, which have no irritant properties or systemic toxicity when given orally, exert a high, unexpected, degree of cytotoxicity.},

These data were used to predict the future burden of mesothelioma mortality in Great Britain. Poisson regression analysis was used to model male mesothelioma deaths from 1968 to 2001 as a function of the rise and fall of asbestos exposure during the 20th century, and hence to predict numbers of male deaths in the years 2002-2050. The annual number of mesothelioma deaths in Great Britain has risen increasingly rapidly from 153 deaths in 1968 to 1848 in 2001 and, using our preferred model, is predicted to peak at around 1950 to 2450 deaths per year between 2011 and 2015. Following this peak, the number of deaths is expected to decline rapidly. The eventual death rate will depend on the background level and any residual asbestos exposure. Between 1968 and 2050, there will have been approximately 90,000 deaths from mesothelioma in Great Britain, 65,000 of which will occur after 2001.},

The fibrogenic potential of numerous types of respirable inorganic particles remains poorly understood but is significantly determined by lung deposition and clearance, the agent's size and solubility, host susceptibility, and other factors. Microanalytic techniques have improved the identification of uncommon or unusual biopersistent particles or elements in fibrotic lung tissue. Recent findings in workers exposed to manmade vitreous fibers, silicon carbide, talc, titanium, cerium, and polyvinyl chloride provide new clinical insights into not only their specific fibrogenic capabilities but also in the broader appreciation that many cases of unexplained interstitial lung disease may be caused by occupational exposures to one or more uncommon airborne substances.},

Diagnosis of DIP is not easy and requires surgical lung biopsy. DIP is usually associated with tobacco smoke. However, the association between smoking and DIP is less robust than that with respiratory bronchiolitis with interstitial lung disease or pulmonary Langerhans' cell histiocytosis; approximately 10-42\% of patients with DIP are nonsmokers. DIP can also occur in patients following exposure to certain inhaled toxins (occupational exposure) and drugs, and may occur in the context of certain viral illnesses and autoimmune diseases. In the context of DIP, occupational exposure should be systematically investigated.},

He did not respond to treatment with corticosteroids. Open lung biopsy examination showed desquamative interstitial pneumonia. Only a single ferruginous body was seen on frozen section, but tissue examination by electron microscopy showed an extraordinary pulmonary burden of mineral dust with especially high concentrations of chrysotile asbestos fibres. This report emphasises the need to consider asbestos fibre as an agent in the aetiology of desquamative interstitial pneumonia. The coexistent slight interstitial fibrosis present in this case is also considered to have resulted from exposure to mineral dust, particularly ultramicroscopic asbestos fibres.},

A total of 107 of the 109 cases (98\%) occurred in smokers, including all 83 current smokers and 24 of 49 ex-smokers (49\%). RB persisted in some patients for many years after stopping smoking, occurring in one third of patients 5 years after quitting, and in one patient 32 years afterwards. A correlation was found between degree of cytoplasmic pigmentation of macrophages and number of pack-years smoked and also between the presence of peribronchiolar fibrosis and number of pack-years. No correlation was found between pulmonary function test results and pathologic findings. A desquamative interstitial pneumonia-like reaction was observed in six individuals. One patient each with a desquamative interstitial pneumonia-like reaction and one with RB were diagnosed based on clinical findings with desquamative interstitial pneumonia and RB-associated interstitial lung disease, respectively. No histologic features distinguished desquamative interstitial pneumonia from a desquamative interstitial pneumonia-like reaction or RB-associated interstitial lung disease from RB. Five cases of variant RB were encountered that resembled RB except that macrophage cytoplasm lacked pigment. All occurred in never-smokers, and their significance is unknown. RB is an accurate histologic marker of cigarette smoking, and it may be found many years after smoking ceases. There are no reliable histologic features to distinguish RB-associated interstitial lung disease from RB or desquamative interstitial pneumonia-like reactions from desquamative interstitial pneumonia.},

The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health hosted a workshop at which consulting pulmonary pathologists reviewed lung tissue samples from all the cases for which lung biopsy material was available (15 of 20 cases known in January 1998). After independent review and scoring of these lung tissue specimens, the pathologists reached consensus that the histopathological findings revealed a characteristic lesion-a lymphocytic bronchiolitis and peribronchiolitis with lymphoid hyperplasia represented by lymphoid aggregates. The pathologists noted that the pathological findings were distinctive when compared with known lung conditions. The clinical presentation for the cases generally included cough, dyspnea, restrictive ventilatory defect with reduction in diffusing capacity, and interstitial markings on chest radiographs or high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scans. Six of the cases improved after removal from workplace exposure without medical treatment. Six others, who had recovered with medical treatment and removal from the workplace, had relapses in both symptoms and objective findings after attempting to return to nylon flock work. With this and other evidence supporting the existence of chronic interstitial pneumonitis associated with nylon flock processing, workshop participants recommended surveillance for early identification of affected workers and their removal from further workplace exposure.},

The ORs for smoking, gender and occupational exposure were estimated using Mantel-Haenszel analysis and conditional logistic regression, controlling for age and year of diagnosis.The adverse effect of smoking was amplified by male gender and occupational exposure, OR 4.6 (95\% CI 2.1 to 10.3) for PF, and OR 3.0 (1.3 to 6.5) for IPF, compared with in non-exposed women. Higher cumulative smoking exposure was linearly associated with increased risks. Compared with smoking less than 10 pack-years, smoking ?20 pack-years was associated with increased risk of PF and IPF, OR 2.6 (1.4 to 4.9) and OR 2.5 (1.3 to 5.0), respectively.Smoking has a dose-related association with increased risk of severe PF.

The clinical effects of H(2)S depend on its concentration and the duration of exposure. H(2)S is immediately fatal when concentrations are over 500-1000 parts per million (ppm) but exposure to lower concentrations, such as 10-500 ppm, can cause various respiratory symptoms that range from rhinitis to acute respiratory failure. H(2)S may also affect multiple organs, causing temporary or permanent derangements in the nervous, cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, and hematological systems. We present a case of occupational exposure to H(2)S leading to multi-organ involvement, acute respiratory failure, organizing pneumonia, and shock resembling acute sepsis. The patient also developed mild obstructive and restrictive pulmonary disease and peripheral neuropathy.},

Out of 24 tinners, eleven tinners (46\%) had HRCTs consistent with DPLD. Of these 11 subjects, HRCT findings were consistent with respiratory bronchiolitis interstitial lung disease in nine, usual interstitial pneumonia pattern in one, and non-specific interstitial pneumonia in one. HRCT patterns consistent with DPLDs are significantly prevalent among Turkish tinners. This is the first field study reporting this occupational lung hazard in tinners.

Our objective was to investigate the prevalence of parenchymal lung diseases among coppersmiths in Kahramanmaras city in Turkey. Thirty coppersmiths were included to the study, and they all signed an informed consent. Demographics, spirometric test results and high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scans, and blood samples were obtained. Laboratory analysis of the serum samples showed that serum copper levels of the subjects were 0.93 +/- 0.14 mg/L. Serum copper level in control group was found as 0.70 +/- 0.14 mg/L, and it was significantly different between the two groups (p < 0.05). Of 30 coppersmiths, 17 HRCT findings are abnormal and seen with diffuse parenchymal interstitial lung disease pattern-ten (58.8\%) respiratory bronchiolitis interstitial lung disease, five (29.4\%) nonspecific interstitial pneumonia, and two (11.8\%) usual interstitial pneumonia. The most prevalent HRCT pattern was micronodular pattern in workers. This is the first field study reporting the radiologic findings of coppersmiths and effect of the occupation on lung diseases.},

Blood indium concentration and personal air sampling data were used to estimate exposure.Abnormalities were uncommon at hire. After hire, prevalence of spirometric restriction was 31\% (n = 14/45), about fourfold higher than expected. Excessive decline in FEV1 was elevated at 29\% (n = 12/41). Half (n = 21/42) had blood indium ?5 µg/l. More recent hires had fewer abnormalities. There was a suggestion that abnormalities were more common among workers with blood indium ?5 µg/l, but otherwise an exposure-response relationship was not evident. Peak dust concentrations were obscured by time averaging.Evolving lung function abnormalities consistent with subclinical indium lung disease appeared common and merit systematic investigation. Traditional measures of exposure and response were not illustrative, suggesting fresh approaches will be needed. Workplace changes seemed to have had a positive though incomplete impact; novel preventive interventions are warranted.},

  abstract    = {Reports of pulmonary fibrosis, emphysema, and, more recently, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) in indium workers suggested that workplace exposure to indium compounds caused several different lung diseases.To better understand the pathogenesis and natural history of indium lung disease, a detailed, systematic, multidisciplinary analysis of clinical, histopathologic, radiologic, and epidemiologic data for all reported cases and workplaces was undertaken.Ten men (median age, 35 years) who produced, used, or reclaimed indium compounds were diagnosed with interstitial lung disease 4-13 years after first exposure (n = 7) or PAP 1-2 years after first exposure (n = 3). Common pulmonary histopathologic features in these patients included intraalveolar exudate typical of alveolar proteinosis (n = 9), cholesterol clefts and granulomas (n = 10), and fibrosis (n = 9). Two patients with interstitial lung disease had pneumothoraces. Lung disease progressed following cessation of exposure in most patients and was fatal in two. Radiographic data revealed that two patients with PAP subsequently developed fibrosis and one also developed emphysematous changes. Epidemiologic investigations demonstrated the potential for exposure to respirable particles and an excess of lung abnormalities among coworkers.Occupational exposure to indium compounds was associated with PAP, cholesterol ester crystals and granulomas, pulmonary fibrosis, emphysema, and pneumothoraces. The available evidence suggests exposure to indium compounds causes a novel lung disease that may begin with PAP and progress to include fibrosis and emphysema, and, in some cases, premature death. Prospective studies are needed to better define the natural history and prognosis of this emerging lung disease and identify effective prevention strategies.},

  abstract    = {Respiratory bronchiolitis (RB) and desquamative interstitial pneumonia (DIP) are closely associated histological patterns of interstitial pneumonia, although there are no studies on the extent of individual histological parameters. Furthermore, the term smoking related-interstitial lung disease (SR-ILD) has been proposed as a term to encompass patients with both these histological patterns who give a history of smoking, though it is not well defined how this term relates to historical cases of DIP. The aim of this study was to compare histological parameters in cases of DIP and RB and then to review in detail clinical, imaging and histological data for DIP in relation to a history of smoking.Forty-nine cases were reviewed, 24 with RB and 25 with DIP; five cases of DIP were re-classified as RB on review due to bronchocentricity of the infiltrate. There was a significantly greater extent of interstitial fibrosis (P = 0.02), lymphoid follicles (P < 0.001) and eosinophilic infiltration (P < 0.0001) in patients with DIP compared with RB. In addition, the extents of these three parameters were significantly interrelated. Patients with DIP had a lower incidence of smoking (60\%) when compared with patients with RB-ILD (93\%) (P < 0.005). Further analysis of smokers versus never-smokers with DIP showed no difference in histological parameters, extent of haemosiderin deposition or the number of CD1a+ macrophages between the two groups, nor were there any differences in clinical data to suggest other aetiologies. Follow-up high-resolution computed tomography data from patients with DIP suggested that a pattern of fibrotic non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) may develop in the long term in both smokers and never-smokers.There are significant differences in the extent of interstitial fibrosis, lymphoid follicles and eosinophilic infiltration between DIP and RB, as well as a much lower incidence of smoking in patients with DIP. Whether the lower reported incidence of smoking in DIP reflects referral bias or conservatism in giving a history of smoking remains uncertain, as neither histological parameters nor clinical data indicate a difference between smokers and never-smokers with DIP. Nevertheless, some cases of DIP are likely to remain idiopathic and unrelated to RB, though still have a good prognosis. Furthermore, they may evolve into a pattern resembling fibrotic NSIP. Therefore, whilst SR-ILD is appropriate in the correct clinical setting, the distinction between the histological patterns of RB and DIP remains appropriate.},

Clinically, patients presented with chronic cough and progressive dyspnea. One was a current light smoker and two were ex-smokers. In 8 patients, a history of possible inhalational exposures, including wood smoke, birds, cotton, pasture, chalk dust, agrochemical compounds, and cocaine use, was elicited. Pulmonary function tests showed moderate to severe physiologic abnormalities, in most instances indicating a restrictive lung disease with decreased peripheral flow rates. Chest radiographs revealed predominantly diffuse reticulonodular infiltrates in the central lung fields, with thickening of the bronchial walls and decreased lung volumes. Chest computed tomography demonstrated peribronchovascular fibrosis and interstitial thickening. Bronchoalveolar lavage showed a mild increase in lymphocytes in 4 subjects. Patients were treated with corticosteroids and bronchodilators. Follow-up data were available in 10 patients. In 5 patients, the disease progressed and 4 of them died. Two patients remained stable and 3 improved or healed. We propose that these findings represent a distinct airway-centered disease that mostly behaves as an interstitial lung disease and may exhibit a poor outcome.},

  abstract    = {Interstitial lung diseases are primarily attributable to occupational or environmental exposures to dusts and irritants. We report on a case of interstitial lung disease, possibly secondary to iron exposure. Our male patient presented with cough and shortness of breath of more than 20 years' duration after his occupational exposure had ended. A chest radiograph showed patchy shadows throughout both lower fields, and computed tomography showed ground-glass-like opacification, with fibrosis in the lower lobes. A lung biopsy revealed foamy cells in the alveolar spaces, with bronchiolitis obliterans. Microelemental analysis showed an increased level of iron in the lung tissue. After treatment with N-acetyl cysteine effervescent tablets, the patient's symptoms gradually improved. This probable case of iron-induced interstitial lung disease suggests the importance of obtaining a patient's history of occupational and environmental exposures for the sake of an accurate diagnosis.},

RB-ILD is clearly connected with tobacco smoking and has been inserted in the "smoking related interstitial lung diseases" together with DIP and Cell histiocytosis of Langerhans; it may also be associated with occupational exposure to machine fumes.

Average respirable particulate was 2.2 mg/m3, ranging from 0.5 to 39.9 mg/m3. Highest levels of particulates were found in the flocking room, and direct reading dust measurements indicate that the highest peak exposures are associated with "blowdown" (a cleaning procedure used between flocking runs). The nature of the airborne particles was investigated using polarized light and scanning electron microscopy. Air samples were found to contain flock particles (fibers nominally 10-15 microm in diameter by about 1000 microm in length) and a variety of respirable particles types, several of which were linked directly to the process. Of special interest were elongated respirable particles, which by microscopic analysis, complemented with melting-point determination, were found to be shreds of nylon.},

There were 491 controls ascertained by random digit dialing and matched to cases on sex, age, and geographic region. Data were collected using a standard telephone questionnaire. Occupational factors were based on a detailed history of jobs lasting 6 months or more and job activity, hobby, and specific substance checklists. Several occupational factors, adjusted for age and smoking in conditional multivariate logistic regression analyses, were significantly associated with IPF: farming (odds ratio (OR) = 1.6, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.0, 2.5); livestock (OR = 2.7, 95\% CI: 1.3, 5.5); hairdressing (OR = 4.4, 95\% CI: 1.2, 16.3); metal dust (OR = 2.0, 95\% CI: 1.0, 4.0); raising birds (OR = 4.7, 95\% CI: 1.6, 14.1); stone cutting/polishing (OR = 3.9, 95\% CI: 1.2, 12.7); and vegetable dust/animal dust (OR = 4.7, 95\% CI: 2.1, 10.4). Interaction was detected between smoking and exposure to livestock (p = 0.06) and farming (p = 0.08). Results confirm previous studies showing increased risk associated with dusty environments.},

At follow-up, 14 patients presented no relapses (no-relapse group, NR) and 18 (56\%) presented relapses (relapsing group, RG) that resolved with ulterior treatment. Multifocal opacities on chest X-ray (RG 83\% vs. NR 36\%, p = 0.02) appeared to be a predictor for relapse. Patients with relapses showed a shorter time span to chest X-ray normalization (RG 8 +/- 8 weeks vs. NR 13 +/- 9 weeks, p = 0.09) that became significant in patients with 3 or more relapses (multiple-relapse group, MR, 4 +/- 2 weeks vs. NR 13 +/- 9 weeks, p < 0.04). Although the initial prednisone dose was similar in patients with relapsing forms, its maintenance was shorter than in patients without relapses, showing a trend to significance (RG 4 +/- 3 weeks, NR 7 +/- 6 weeks, p = 0.09). Lower levels of lactate dehydrogenase and gamma-glutamyltransferase, although always within the normal range, were found in patients with relapsing forms.COP is a specific but infrequent form of OP with a good response to steroid therapy. Relapses are frequent and typical characteristics of COP which resolved with ulterior treatment. Multifocal opacities on chest X-ray and a shorter maintenance of the initial steroid dose may increase the risk of relapse.},

  abstract    = {Despite the advances in medical therapy and technology, the prognosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) remains poor and the need for disease prevention based on identifying the risk factors becomes mandatory. Occupational and environmental exposures were studied in several countries and found to play important role in the disease development. However, in Egypt, a little attention has been paid to study the effect of these factors in the disease development.To identify the occupational and environmental risk factors associated with the development of IPF in Egypt.A multicenter hospital-based case-control study was carried out in chest hospitals affiliated to three Egyptian cities-Cairo, Tanta and Mansoura. Subjects were 201 patients with confirmed IPF (cases) and 205 age-, sex- and residence-matched controls. Data on occupational and environmental factors were obtained from a questionnaire. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to determine the independent risk factors of IPF in both sexes for single factors with adjustment for age, residence and smoking status.Compared with the controls, the risk of IPF in male workers was observed to increase significantly in chemical and petrochemical industries and carpentry and wood working (OR = 2.56, 95\% CI: 1.02-7.01), and with occupational exposures to wood dust and wood preservatives. Among female workers, a significant increase was observed in farming (OR = 3.34, 95\% CI: 1.17-10.12), raising birds and occupational exposures to animal feeds, products and dusts and pesticides. Risk of IPF decreased significantly in male workers and insignificantly among female workers in sales and clerical related activities. The environmental exposures to birds and cats were significantly associated with elevated risk of IPF development in both sexes.In Egypt, farming, raising birds and wood working are important risk factors for the development of IPF.},

  abstract    = {The present study evaluated the possible effects of exposure to polypropylene flock on respiratory health and serum cytokines in a cross-sectional study of workers from a plant in Turkey. A total of 50 polypropylene flocking workers were compared to a control group of 45 subjects. All subjects filled out a respiratory questionnaire and underwent a physical examination, a chest radiograph and pulmonary function testing, including single breath carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DL,CO). Serum interleukin-8 (IL-8) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were measured. Additionally, high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the chest was performed in 10 exposed workers with low DL,CO. Work-related respiratory symptoms were reported in 26\% of the exposed subjects and in 13.3\% of the controls. Logistic regression analysis showed that the risk of respiratory symptoms increased 3.6 fold in polypropylene flocking workers when compared to controls. Parameters of the study group, including per cent predicted: forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in one second, forced mid-expiratory flow 25-75\% and DL,CO, were significantly lower than in controls. Multivariate analyses showed that being a polypropylene flocking worker was a predictive factor for impairment of pulmonary function. Serum IL-8 and TNF-alpha levels were increased in the study group compared with the controls. HRCT revealed peribronchial thickening and diffuse ground glass attenuation in some subjects. The present study suggests the presence of subtle or the beginning of interstitial lung disease in these polypropylene flocking workers.},

These workers had generally higher prevalences of respiratory symptoms. Flock workers and employees with longer tenure at areas where flock-coated cards are processed were more likely to have restrictive impairment of lung function. Although dust and fiber samples were largely below the detection limits, peak exposures to airborne particulate occurred during cleaning with compressed air.Working with rayon flock and cleaning with compressed air were associated with health effects in workers at this plant.},

SEM was used to locate inorganic particulates in situ, which were individually analyzed using energy dispersive X-ray analysis.

However, analysis of individual cases revealed more specific associations. The concentration of particles determined by SEM exceeded that found by LM by a factor ranging from 2.7 to 964. The concentration of inorganic particulates per cm3 in the areas of PAP ranged from 1.3 X 10(7) to 1.02 X 10(9). Controls all had less than 10(7) particles per cm3. Available environmental history correlated well with particulate analysis results, e.g., silica in a sandblaster, metal fumes in a welder, and cement particles in a cement finisher. Particulates with unique composition were also found in cases with unavailable histories, e.g. metal fumes suggestive of welding or soldering exposure, silicates suggestive of fine particle exposure (greater than 50% of particles less than 1 micron).

Forty-five consecutive patients with PAP were enrolled. Each patient with PAP was assessed for baseline clinical characteristics, chest high-resolution CT (HRCT), serum GMAb and occupational exposure. Fifty healthy controls were included to define normal ranges for GMAb levels. Ninety-seven hospital controls with other respiratory diseases were included to establish prevalence of a history of occupational inhalation exposure. According to the serum GMAb cut-off value of 2.39 μg/mL, 84.4% of the recruited patients with PAP had positive serum GMAb with a median level of 28.7 μg/mL, defined as autoimmune PAP, and the remaining 15.6% had negative serum GMAb with a median level of 0.16 μg/mL, defined as non-autoimmune PAP. Also, 34.2% of patients with autoimmune PAP had a history of occupational inhalational exposure, which was not significantly higher than that of hospital controls (34.2% vs 19.6%, p=0.072). Four patients with PAPo showed negative GMAb. Their arterial oxygen tension, pulmonary function parameters and chest HRCT features were significantly different when compared with patients with autoimmune PAP (p<0.05). These four non-autoimmune occupational lung disease cases culminated in 3 deaths and a lung transplant. A number of patients with PAP who may have occupational inhalational exposure and negative serum GMAb represent a high possibility of silicoproteinosis and very poor survival.},

  abstract        = {Quantitative birefringent particle counts per 10 high-power fields in lung tissue were correlated with age, sex, and occupational exposure in 37 cases of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. Counts were significantly higher in pulmonary alveolar proteinosis cases in both regions of alveolar proteinosis (47 +/- 11) and perivascular and peribronchiolar areas (dust retention areas) (275 +/- 65) than in 13 controls (5 +/- 3 and 79 +/- 23, respectively). Of a total of 8619 particles, 4817 were less than 1 micron, and 3771 were 1 to 10 microns in diameter. Fifty-nine percent were round, 19% fibrous, and 22% irregular. When analyzed individually, 20 of 37 cases (78%) had alveolar particle counts significantly higher than controls, and 10 of 26 cases had dust-retention area counts greater than controls (P less than 0.050). Known or possible occupational exposure was ascertained in 13 cases. In the remaining 24 cases insufficient occupational information was available. The mean age of the pulmonary alveolar proteinosis patients was 33 +/- 4 years, and of the controls, 40 +/- 7 years, and there was a male-to-female ratio of approximately 3:1. We propose that many cases of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis will ultimately be shown to be associated with environmental exposures to fine dusts or fumes.},

  abstract    = {Hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) is responsible for many incidents of occupational toxic exposure, especially in the petroleum industry. The clinical effects of H(2)S depend on its concentration and the duration of exposure. H(2)S is immediately fatal when concentrations are over 500-1000 parts per million (ppm) but exposure to lower concentrations, such as 10-500 ppm, can cause various respiratory symptoms that range from rhinitis to acute respiratory failure. H(2)S may also affect multiple organs, causing temporary or permanent derangements in the nervous, cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, and hematological systems. We present a case of occupational exposure to H(2)S leading to multi-organ involvement, acute respiratory failure, organizing pneumonia, and shock resembling acute sepsis. The patient also developed mild obstructive and restrictive pulmonary disease and peripheral neuropathy.},
